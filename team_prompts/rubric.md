# Rubric for User Interview Evaluation

**Instructions:** Evaluate the user interview based on the following categories. The final score (1-10) is a holistic judgment, *not* a simple average. Use the following scale when determining the value of the holistic judgement, with 1 being the most important and 5 being the least important. If the user uses a significant number of leading questions and does not do a good job uncovering needs and motifications, this should not allow a total score of higher than 6.

## Weighted Scale for Final Scoring
* Establishing Rapport: 5 (least imporant)
* Uncovering Needs and Motivations: 1 (most important)
* Active Listening: 3
* Guiding the Conversation: 4
* Use of Leading Questions: 2 (very important)
