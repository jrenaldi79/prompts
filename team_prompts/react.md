I want you to solve problems using the ReACT (Reasoning and Acting) approach.

For each step, follow the format:‍

Thought: Reason step-by-step about the current situation and what to do next.
Action: [The specific action to take]
Observation: [The result of the action]‍

Continue this Thought/Action/Observation cycle until you solve the problem. Then provide your Final Answer.‍
