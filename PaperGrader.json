              "message": "=You are an AI assistant tasked with grading student final papers on product strategy. Evaluate each paper based on the rubric and class transcripts (provided separately), assigning a score out of 100. An incredibly poor grade would be a 75. If it's a solid paper, it should be a minimum of 85. A really good paper is minimum of 90.\n\nYour goal is to provide constructive and actionable feedback to help students **improve their ability to build product strategies**. Focus on providing supportive, encouraging, specific, and actionable guidance, not just criticism.\n\nStart each response with a **Final Score:** \\[Score]/100 as well as a two-paragraph summary of the feedback that can be given to the student. Use a tone which is friendly and less formal for all feedback, like you're chatting with a student during office hours.\n\n**Feedback Summary (Two Paragraphs):**\n\n* Provide a two-paragraph summary encapsulating the overall strengths and weaknesses of the paper in terms of demonstrating a customer-centric approach to product strategy.\n\n* Maintain a friendly and encouraging tone, like you're chatting with a student during office hours.\n\n* Briefly reiterate 1-2 key actionable suggestions for improvement across the paper, focusing on how they can strengthen the connection to customer understanding.\n\n**Grading Sections Feedback** below. Each section should have a score out of 10, along with specific quotes from the paper to highlight areas for improvement and actionable suggestions to make the paper stronger and demonstrate deeper customer understanding.\n\n**Example feedback tonality:**\n\nOverall this is a solid doc. It's light on insights, trends and secondary research that makes me jump out and say, this is the bet to go all in on.\n\nIf I was Brian, I would say come back when you have a more convincing story. You've got the right start and shell, and something to pique my interest, but it needs more meat on the bones to convince the reader this is one of the bullets to fire this year and make a bet on.\n\nI'd want to see a bit more on the eCommerce integration too as I think that's a part that could be a bigger story. Also as mentioned, this feels like an opportunity to go head to head with some of the fashion / personal shopper services but we don't talk about them at all which seems like a miss.\n\nI should note, I really appreciate the structure and flow of the doc however. You did a great job on the intro email, and putting it all together. It's nicely polished as a deliverable.\n\n\n**Inputs:** Student Paper, Class Transcripts, Rubric (below).\n\n**Grading Sections Feedback:**\n\n**1. Memo / Executive Summary Feedback (Score: /10)**\n\n* Provide specific feedback on how effectively the memo captures the essence of the product strategy for an executive audience.  Does it clearly highlight the problem, proposed solution, and key recommendations? Make sure this section really exists. It should be a separate section in the paper.\n\n* Quote a part of the memo that is effective or could be improved in terms of grabbing executive attention and conveying key information concisely.\n\n* Suggest one actionable way to strengthen the memo to better resonate with a CEO, division head, or CPO, perhaps by focusing on the \"so what?\" for the company.\n\n\n\n**2. Problem Statement Feedback (Score: /10)**\n\n* Provide specific feedback on how well the problem statement reflects a deep understanding of customer needs and pain points. Is the problem framed from a customer-centric perspective?\n\n* Quote a part of the problem statement that clearly articulates the problem or could be strengthened to emphasize the customer impact.\n\n* Suggest one actionable way to make the problem statement more compelling by grounding it more firmly in customer insights (even if not explicitly stated as coming from interviews in the paper, encourage that mindset).\n\n**3. Innovation Analysis Feedback (Score: /10)**\n\n* Assess how well the innovation analysis uses course concepts to analyze the market and customer landscape. Do the chosen concepts illuminate customer needs or unmet demands?\n\n* Identify if the student clearly explained and justified the relevance of each concept in understanding the customer or market situation.\n\n* Quote an example of a concept application, and suggest how the analysis could be deepened or improved to provide richer insights into customer behavior or market dynamics, potentially referencing class transcripts to suggest specific frameworks that are customer-focused.\n\n\n\n**4. Product Brief Feedback (Score: /10)**\n\n* Evaluate how well the product brief translates customer understanding into a compelling solution. Are the features customer-centric?\n\n* Quote a part of the product brief that clearly articulates the value proposition or could be improved to better resonate with the target customer.\n\n* Suggest one actionable way to enhance the product brief to be even more customer-focused, ensuring the value proposition and features directly address the problem statement and customer needs.\n\n\n\n**5. Team Structure Feedback (Score: /10)**\n\n* Assess whether the proposed team structure is designed to effectively iterate and learn based on customer feedback. Are there elements that would facilitate rapid customer feedback loops in the team structure?\n\n* Evaluate the justification and practicality of the proposed team structure in the context of understanding and responding to customer needs throughout the project.\n\n* Quote a part of the team structure section and suggest a way to better optimize the team for incorporating and acting on customer insights, perhaps by referencing *Loonshots* concepts related to information flow or feedback mechanisms within teams.\n\n\n\n**6. PR / FAQ Feedback (Score: /10)**\n\n* Evaluate how well the PR/FAQ anticipates and addresses customer questions and concerns. Does it demonstrate empathy and understanding of the customer perspective?\n\n* Assess if the PR/FAQ effectively communicates the product's value and benefits *from the customer's point of view*.\n\n* Quote a question or answer from the PR/FAQ and suggest how it could be improved to be even more customer-centric in its language and focus, and more clearly address potential customer hesitations or misunderstandings.\n\n\n\n**Grading Checklist:**\n\n1. **Missing Section Penalty:** -10 points for each missing section (out of 100 total).\n\n2. **Criteria-Based Scoring:** For present sections, evaluate quality using rubric criteria (below) and provide detailed feedback as outlined above.\n\n3. **Innovation Analysis (Course Concepts):** Verify 4 distinct concepts (1 from each of first 4 classes, using transcripts), clear identification, thoughtful application, and explained relevance to strategy.\n\n4. **Team Structure (Loonshots):** Check for Loonshots concepts (Artists/Soldiers, equilibrium, system mindset) and class content integration, justification for structure.\n\n5. **Final Score:** Calculate final score and present at the beginning of the response.\n\n\n\n**Rubric:**\n\n\n\n| **Section**             | **Description/Requirements (Succinct)**                                   | **Criteria for Evaluation (Succinct)**                                         | **Points if Missing** |\n\n|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|\n\n| **1.

              "value": "= * **John Renaldi**   * 00:00:04   * Good time. Good morning, guys. Morning, all right, let's get at it.   * Hey, guys? Good morning.   * Alright. So my name is John. Good to see all of you, some of you I've met before, to others a new face so welcome. Hello\\! I'll introduce myself a little bit more as we get going today. You guys hear me? All right.   * online. I probably need to put this on.   * ![Joshua Cameron][image2]   * **Joshua Cameron**   * 00:00:32   * Yes.   * ![John Renaldi][image3]   * **John Renaldi**   * 00:00:32   * Okay? Oh, all right.   * amazing. We have an awesome day. Today. We have my favorite guest speaker that's joining us lior, Ron. We are very blessed to have him. He's the founder and CEO of Uber freight. He has quite an astounding story for how he started his business. There's been some drama like any good startup story.   * his probably more than others. His co-founder, was arrested and jailed, and was recently pardoned by President Trump on his way out.   * and so that definitely creates some intrigue with this speaker. But suffice to say, he did end up building, though an amazing business, despite all of those headwinds against him, and so lior is somebody that I've known for the past. Oh, my gosh\\! Probably 15 years or so, and so we're very fortunate to have him come with. Talk to us today.   * so we'll we'll share a little bit more about him as he joins around 9 30 today. In terms of our agenda today. Oh, here we   * see if it's working.   * There we go.   * Here we go. So we've got a lot to get over and get through so   * we will try to move as expediently as possible.   * we're going to try to make enough time to have a really good class discussion and exercise towards the end around golden circles, and so we will need our laptops for that to take some notes, but by and large, as I mentioned in the syllabus. We are going to try to keep our laptops down for today and really move to the old school analog written notes.   * You will all get a full transcript of this meeting. So, my own AI note taker, I will share all of those notes with you. You'll get them immediately after class.   * You'll get all the transcripts, because what I'd like you all to do is take that transcript file and add it right into notebook. Lm.   * so I was told this morning that you cannot access notebook. Lm, via your Northwestern email. So you'll need to use your personal gmail account. But when you do so, you can just add the transcript directly into notebook. Lm, and then you can be able to chat away with the entire notes that we had today, and it will be sort of like a mini version of me right on your desktop.   * So you can also add your personal notes into that notebook as as well. So if you have an android phone, you already have the Google drive App. If you are an iphone user download, Google, drive   * real easily, you can just go ahead and open up Google Drive. And there's a little plus button. And you can take a photo of your notes, your handwritten notes and add it to Google Drive. And when you're in notebook, lm, you'll just add that as a source that actually your handwritten notes and it will transcribe all of your handwritten notes, and give you an AI summary of your own notes directly in the tool. So you will have an old school. Yes, analog experience.   * but becomes very much AI powered as soon as you add it into that flow. So that's what we're going to do for today. We will need your phones.   * Order your laptops, probably your phones to take our short quiz. Unfortunately, in years past we've not had a great number of students that have done the pre-readings which are needed for us to have a really great discussion in class, and so we will be doing here and there some short quizzes. I will tell you in advance, but just to make sure that everyone is doing our readings, and to make sure that those students that have done the pre-reads   * are not being held back in class by those that maybe have not. So with that, we're going to have a just a short quiz. You can open up your phones, take the QR code short 5 questions. We'll give you a couple minutes to complete that.   * Anyone need more time.   * Yep, okay.   * Morning morning.   * Yeah. How are we looking any more time. Needed everybody. Good.   * Yep, okay, not too bad.   * All right. So, as I mentioned, I'd introduce myself a little bit more again. My name is John, this is my 4th year teaching at the program. This is my 3rd year teaching this particular course.   * so happy to be back again. Good to see many of you a little bit about my background and some of my biases, because most of my experience has been pretty much in the consumer world.   * While I invest in. I consult with and work around b 2 b businesses. Most of my personal experiences have been consumer businesses, and also oftentimes in a mix of hardware software, e-commerce types of businesses. So I don't have any practical experiences from marketplaces, those types of businesses. So a lot of my background and some of my biases   * are around that I try my best to acknowledge that, and to surround myself with lots of other experts and people, my network to complement that. But that's a little bit about my background. I've recently decided to spend some more time with my family, and to lean more into academia by teaching here more as well as down in champaign at the University of Illinois. So I left corporate world back in July, and haven't been haven't been happier in my life. I don't think so. It's really great to be here all with you.   * Okay, a little bit about some of my product background and experiences. So my really 1st big product and business that I was able to develop was something called Motomaker, and this was the very 1st built to order customizable smartphone platform, and still the only where you could go ahead and customize a smartphone online. Have it built for you just to your own specifications and shipped to you within about 5 days   * from a factory that I created in Dallas Fort Worth.   * And so that was a business that I pitched to the Google Executives when they purchased Motorola and I spent 2 years. Once I got that approved by Larry Page and team to build this out as a way to start to have a more direct to consumer relationship. At the time cell phone manufacturers really sold. They thought their customer was the carrier.   * They didn't really think about the end user which is crazy to think of. But that was, in fact, true. They built for a carrier customer for a channel. And so when Google purchased Motorola. The question that was posed to me and the team that I was on which was.   * How do we have a more direct line to our end user come back to us with ideas. I pitched this. We approved it. 2 years later we launched the business, scaled that to about 250 million in revenue within about 18 months, built 3 factories around the world to enable that. And in that experience I also have to highlight how I massively fucked up   * because these are some of the things that we learn most in our lives and our careers is when you really have a failure, and how you learn from that? Mine was I crashed all of Motorola's internal sites as well as our external websites, not once.   * but twice on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, and so had a lot of lessons from that, and as doing that as the person in charge.   * I had to get up on stage in front of the entire company and apologize to them.   * So it was a very humbling experience, one that I'll never forget. My second endeavor really worth noting is a company I created called Geobit. I sold that business to a company called Life 360 in 2021,   * and in that business some of my failures. Of course, some things we can control, some things we not is that I went through as many other small business owners did, Covid, and saw our sales disappear pretty much overnight. And so we had a sales drop of 90% in one day. That continued for about 3 months.   * We were selling no product. And so this gets to our business model, which we will explore a little bit today in terms of the 10 types of innovations, but also into the capstone programs. What was incredibly important, though, about that business was we had reoccurring revenue.   * So even though our new sales dropped, we had reoccurring revenue from a Saas platform which was paying the bills every single month for us. It insulated the business risk. Now we still had to unfortunately let go about 30% of the company at that point in time, because of   * the way in which our business was operating, we just could not continue having the overhead with with that. So we did do some furloughs. We hired them all back, but a super painful experience that was really my second big business and and product that I launched. And then, 3rd was, I joined Google in 2022,   * after I sold my business and ran wearable software for them. And in that experience, we had to focus. So part of   * part of what we're going to be talking about today is being able to focus focus focus focus. And I had to make some very quick and hard calls   * where we had to let go of some customers. So, being able to go to customers and tell them that we weren't going to be supported anymore. Also, just a really difficult conversation to have lots of learnings that I had there. So just a little bit of my background again influences my thinking, and has unfortunately, some biases, as I think, about the world. And so I'm happy to also learn from all of you, since I know many of you come from   * different backgrounds.   * This clicker is not very good. Okay, before we get going. And we start with our 1st guest, lecturer, guest, speaker, lior. I wanted to start off really with a story, to talk about innovation.   * I often find that the storytelling is really helpful to get you to understand a particular topic. And in this case   * we're going to go ahead and rewind the clock quite a number of years ago.   * We're going to go back to the early 1920 S.   * And United States at this time was, you know, the roaring twenties, flappers, speakeasies, everyone's having having a blast.   * and we all know what happens just a number of years later in terms of the stock market crash. But at this point in time things are going rather well. The world just came out of World War one. No one's really at conflict, everyone's pretty peaceful. And so in this period of time. Innovations that take place.   * aren't necessarily looked at with much urgency, particularly in the field of things that might have to do with warfare. And so there's an individual by the name of Leo Young, and Leo is a budding scientist, and him and his team are researching radio communications.   * And in radio communications they are testing this with   * with kind of across a channel, and they're trying to to to communicate across a channel in the Potomac River.   * And when they do this they find out that there's some interference that happens when there's a ship that passes by. Oh, my goodness, this is really quite bad\\!   * No\\!   * So   * the ship goes by in the channel, and as it passes through they notice that there's some interference with the radio transmission signal.   * long story short, they discovered radar. So they figured out a way to detect something that comes by. And so they're pretty excited by this. They run it up the flagpole. Try to ask for funding.   * So they they discover this thing. They frame it as what they're doing. This is amazing. They get back a big, fat rejection.   * There's really no pain at this point in time. There's no imminent threat. The country's safe, so there's not a lot of desire to take big risks. This still seems like a bit of a moonshot to the higher ups. They don't totally believe them. There's really no senior champion that's really these are low level scientists. There's no one really of of stature that's really helping   * champion this technology and their case. And so they get rejection back, saying, sorry guys, no dice.   * I'm just going to go ahead and move over here because   * we are having some issues with our clickers.   * Okay, next thing they do   * is they aim it up at the sky, and they're trying to figure out a way to help planes land in when there's dense fog or clouds.   * And so they do this again by sending some little transmissions. They also figure out in doing so as they're doing this beaconing technology, that they figure out that this radar works for things in the sky, not just things across a channel. They run up the flagpole again.   * and they think like this has got to be it like, hey? If we can detect planes, maybe they're not so interested in boats. But certainly this brand new technology planes just came out. I mean, we're talking about the 19 twenties   * just 10 years, 15 years earlier. This came out. So this is clearly it. This is the way we're going to convince our superiors to fund us.   * And unfortunately, I think we know where this goes. This often happens even in our own businesses, where we're trying to pitch things up to maybe other folks in the organization, and we hear no and no, and no, and no again, even though we're convinced these things must be the next innovative thing.   * And so they come back.   * and they say, Hey, you know, hit us up in maybe 5 years from now. This seems like something that's like   * out in left field when we've got problems to solve right here and now we got to worry. We're building tanks like, can you do anything with that   * like that's our core business right now, we're not really investing much in planes. And all this fancy radar stuff, our franchise business or the things that we are doing right now the things that not make us money, but in the world of business. That's how it would be framed, as is the thing that's right in front of me right now. This other thing seems like it's on Horizon 3\\. It's far out in left field. It seems like a science project. Sorry. Come back to me later.   * So   * the organization at this time is really not set up for this type of thinking. The organization being the Us. Military, they have focused on a business of really innovative around the thing that's right in front of them. They have no structure, they have no process, they have no culture for any sort of longer term thinking.   * We all think this is crazy now. But at the time this is how the organization was set up, there was no real research and development.   * and any of the research and development that took place was often looked at, kind of looked down on like. These people are out in left field making stuff up. It's never going to make it. It's never. It can never be translated to our real problems.   * And so it takes them all the way until the 19 thirties. So it takes them about over 1015 years to finally get radar, which is crazy to think finally gets radar funded as a project after discovering it in the twenties.   * But meanwhile, across the Atlantic in the United Kingdom   * they're feeling a different type of pain that's motivating them to innovate much faster.   * And it's because of what's going on in Nazi, Germany.   * And when this break, when war breaks out, the United Kingdom   * feels that pain very acutely right across the English Channel.   * and so what they end up doing is, not only do they simultaneously discover radar.   * but they fund it immediately and deploy it commercially within a number of years. Not 15 years. We're talking less than like 3,   * and they deploy it all across the entire coastline in a secret project, so that they can detect when planes are approaching, and when the Germans are approaching they know where to send their Spitfire fighters to intercept them.   * The Germans had no idea that they had discovered this. They had no idea how the British could continuously send fighters exactly where their planes were, but they felt that pain very, very, very acutely unlike the Americans.   * and they had figured out ways to have champions and people to sponsor these projects, to get them through, and be able to connect all the disparate groups to commercialize that thing in rapid, rapid fashion.   * And so.   * as this all goes on, the United States a particular individual named Vannever Bush. He's an mit graduate. He's also an Mit professor. At the time he spent his early career in the military.   * He looks at this problem and says, You know what this is never going to work in its current structure. We need to build a completely new organization that sits outside of the traditional institution of the military that is empowered to go off and explore these new technologies, but not just go off in left field. We're going to go ahead and build out a way to ensure that this technology that we discover is integrated directly in with   * the people in the field, they build a way to essentially do customer discovery. They put their scientists in with the soldiers. And so, while these new researchers are sitting out to explore and have a phase separation between the organizations.   * They're not given the same type of constraints of the traditional legacy organization. They don't have to have the same okrs or performance reviews or hitting certain types of numbers. They're given some extra freedoms to explore, because if they weren't, they would always be focused on only the thing that's right in front of them. He realizes this. He needs to give them some space, so he creates this phase separation.   * but he also realizes that the key to win here is the transfer of that knowledge from one organization into the other, because if they're out doing this, they need the soldiers to implement it. They need the soldiers to use it. And so they implement a process essentially of customer discovery, where they take their scientists and pair them directly with the different military branches, and bring some of those military branches into the organization, and put some of their scientists into their organization.   * They swap roles.   * So this is his idea. He creates the office of scientific research and development. Today this is known as Darpa. Anyone familiar with what Darpa is   * great. So that's today's version of this is the Military's and Defense Department's research arm. What Osd created that you may know it's most successful. Well, at least the most well-known would be the Manhattan project.   * but he realizes that the issue here isn't necessarily the creation of new ideas. Think back to Leo Young. He had the idea of radar for 20 years, and it just languished forever. So he realizes the issue is not coming up with the new ideas itself. It's the transfer of that knowledge back into an organization to actually execute on it, and be able to ensure that the   * organization that's responsible for execution does not view this other organization as a threat or competing priority, but sees them as a partner.   * And so when he and his team go over to Europe, they kick off this whole thing, they kick off all of this. They also realize that ideas aren't only sourced internally. They also look outside.   * and so they go to the United Kingdom to get some inspiration. Winston Churchill calls them up, and he says he invites them over and says, we want to show you some things.   * So they all go over there. And at the time, as you may know, if you research history, there's lots of cargo being shipped across the Atlantic. The industry within the United Kingdom can't create much technology because they don't have the raw supplies. All the shipping lanes are being torpedoed by the Germans, and so they really have an ulterior motive. Here is they want to impress the Americans   * and give them technology so that the Americans will go create it for them because they just simply can't. They do not have the industry and the supply chain to do it.   * And so they create essentially what is thought of as a licensing agreement. And so Vannevar Bush and his team show up. Winston Churchill and his team shows them all sorts of new technologies, and they say we're going to give you all of it. We're going to give you all of our IP. We're going to give you all of our design documents. We're going to give you access to all of our scientists. But we need your help to actually make this stuff happen.   * And so the United States is like sounds amazing. We have this new research arm. Exactly for this. They take this new acquired technology and some of this technology that they're taking, they're thinking of as a way to help   * stop all of the torpedo and shipping lane issues that are happening. So they're thinking, all right. If there's anything that they've discovered in this radar technology that's more advanced than us. Can we acquire, then accelerate some of the things we've done?   * So they find out that there is this new type of let me go back. Here, there we go.   * There is a new type of microwave radar that the brits have uncovered, that miniaturizes the microwave radar. What is to become powering microwave radar to the size that something could fit into like a car. So instead of having these huge   * towers that need to be used to detect something. They've been able to shrink something down into the size that could fit in like into a car. And so they had a yet another breakthrough. This kind of 10 x 100 x breakthrough. They give this to the United States and say, Hey, make something of this.   * So Vannevar Bush and his team take that they kick off customer discovery with pilots. They start putting this into airplanes that try to detect U-boats in order to direct their own fire to sink the U-boats. So at the time again, we have just really no way of entering the war. The United Kingdom is at risk of complete implosion because they can't supply their own war machine.   * And so they go. Put these on some planes. They quickly realize that the pilots aren't using them at all. It's a ui ux problem. They don't know how to operate the machine way, too kind. It's got like 30 different buttons all over it. It was completely designed by an engineer or scientist. And so they're doing this back and forth, iteration, figuring out how to create these buttons and automate some of the stuff so it could be very easily done by a pilot that has.   * you know. Maybe you know, 2 years of total training in anything, let alone this complex machine.   * So they go ahead and implement this and the results speak for themselves. You can see in 1943 in about March. There's a winter lull here.   * but that shoots right back up. This is where they take the radar, the microwave radar from the United Kingdom. They shrink it down. They put into a plane, and immediately they start seeing success, they start sinking U-boats. The merchant traffic can get across the Atlantic.   * and Hitler goes ahead and says, this is an unsustainable venture, and he cancels his invasion plans for United Kingdom.   * That was done because of an invention that could have been done by the United States many, many, many years prior, but was never given a chance to thrive and succeed, not because of a lack of idea.   * but because of a lack of structure, a lack of a particular organizational structure, lack of champions, a lack of transfer of technology. And this is really why I like to start this class with the stories because we all come in typically thinking of innovation as breakthrough technologies and breakthrough ideas which are certainly an ingredient of it. But what we're going to be talking about over the next 5 weeks is not necessarily how to come up with more ideas.   * I think there's a lot of great ideas. It's how to think about building out a certain type of framework, to accelerate those ideas, to build the structures, to allow them to thrive and to give you the tools to build teams and organizations, to make this a repeatable process, and to ensure that these ideas don't go off into left field, and are brought into an organization to execute upon them.   * And so the kind of summary of this is as follows, is   * almost every breakthrough. Innovation goes through 3 failures. And so, as you're thinking in your own business or your own product, and you hit a wall, what I implore you to think about is that that wall was in place for every other innovator that was out there. Do not abandon that idea or that particular project because you hit your 1st boss that said, No.   * that will always happen. And if you have that conviction, I'd like you to really take some inspiration from all the other innovators and many, many other stories, including just about every single entrepreneur that I've spoken to, including all of my experiences that see almost this exact same rule, which is, you get no, at least 3 times before you get a yes.   * And so this exact thing happened with the story that we just walked through with radar. It was a no, it was a no, it was a No until it was a yes.   * also the role of champions in leadership.   * When I was at Motorola when I pitched one of these ideas, particularly motormaker, I want to go back. I pitched that idea twice before in 6 years earlier, and then, 3 years before that it took until the 3rd time that I finally got a yes, and what made that lax time really successful in terms of execution   * was that we decided to build a true champion that had cross-functional leadership. And what that meant was we decided within the company that this wouldn't be a product management   * project. This wouldn't be an engineering project. We'd build essentially a GM structure around it. So we put a champion in charge and all of the functions, took their resources and had them temporarily resource aligned to that particular general manager. They stayed reporting into their old bosses. So we built a hybrid   * organization where the reporting line stayed within their function. Mechanical engineers continue to report into the mechanical engineering group electrical engineers and Electrical engineering group, but they went on assignment to a particular general manager, and for all intents and purposes that person was their boss for the length of that particular project.   * and by having that champion across everything. They could have more of a general manager view, and we could go ahead and run that really as a full P. And L. Business. That was the really unlock of. Why, that the 3rd time it finally worked was we had a structure put in place to accelerate that innovation across the organization.   * Also, we'll notice that oftentimes. And if in the readings you picked up on this, too, from Peter Thiel is, we're looking for these ideas that have 10 x multipliers, not just 20% improvement projects. These are the incremental projects these are things that can stay within the same organization they've been in.   * We're looking to how to create these 10 x improvements. How do we create an organization or a team that sits a little bit outside? We want to create this phase separation. Put them a little bit outside the franchise team.   * Give them some space to explore. And we're looking for those problems that we can solve that have 10 x improvement.   * And we saw that not only in the solution we just or the radar experience that we just went through, but also. And when I think of almost all of the projects that I saw that had big breakthroughs, they all had some metric where we were able to 10 x. Whether it was margin improvement, whether it was retention, whether some some type of business metric we were able to 10 x. It doesn't always have to be a product.   * It can be a process. It can be all types of different types of innovations. When you went through and read the 10 types of innovation book again trying to reinforce that this class. And what we're going to be talking about is not just   * product innovations, the ideas, the technology, it's all of the other sustaining things, because what the trap you get into when you only focus on that improvement of the product is, there's always going to be someone else out there that is going to try to one up you.   * It's this vicious cycle of features, specs and feeds that it's really hard to get away from. And so what we want you to start thinking about is not just these peer product type innovations, but the strategy innovations that make it a more durable business.   * And so one of those types of examples is American airlines in Pan am going back into the deregulated and regulation of the airline industry back in like the seventies. Whenever that happened   * you had an airline. Some of you may remember, maybe know called Pan Am. Pan. Am doesn't exist anymore.   * And there's a reason for that. But at the time Pan Am. Was thought of as the company that was too big to fail. And we've probably heard of those companies before too big to fail. And they were the absolute innovator. People couldn't believe how that company couldn't exist anymore because they were thought of as the absolute market leader. They had the best, newest planes, all the coolest new features.   * They had it all, but they only focused on this P-type innovation. And what ended up happening was American airlines came along and they decided, you know, we can't compete head to head with this. We're going to go ahead and innovate in a different way. We're going to build a new business model.   * And we're going to call it points and miles.   * And we're going to create this program where, if you fly with us, you get these miles.   * And they built the very 1st mileage program. And this wasn't a thing. This was a brand new thing for them. And that is why American airlines still exists today was because of that. Innovation wasn't necessarily like a breakthrough technology. Innovation like Pan Am was doing. It was a strategy innovation, and that ultimately had the staying power and the durability to continue on as a business.   * Okay? So with that, that really kind of gives you a good background for how we're going to approach this next 5 weeks, giving you some of these tools, some of these lessons, and to try to think less and less about technology and more about how do we build these structures? How do we give you these tools? And how do we build more sustainable innovations that aren't just product or product systems, innovations. But more strategy.   * And in terms of our syllabus. And what we're going to be focusing on is not like I mentioned is about kind of not giving you just like a process or a template, but giving you these tools, I'd say by and large every company that I've been fortunate to work with or for there's no like definitive set like this is how you innovate.   * It's really about building that culture and hiring the right people and giving them those tools to allow that innovation to thrive, and setting up the right structure to allow it to thrive. Not just a process. I think there's a trap that many times companies fall into is they kind of create this innovation process as if it can just sort of be formulaic   * when more likely than not, what has to happen is give it the right type of people, the right types of tools, the right type of structure to be put into place. And the way to transfer that technology and those ideas back and forth from the franchise business   * to a kind of a research business or research arm.   * The 5 modules that we're going to be walking through over the next 5 weeks will be looking at innovation. And these processes and these transfers and these structures and tools through the lens of not just bigger companies, but also startups. So as you think about maybe starting your own enterprise, or if you want to work for or work in or start your own startup, we'll be talking about innovation through 2 different lenses, because it's   * very, very different innovation through a startup and small business and innovation in a larger organization you will approach very, very differently. We want to make sure that we walk through and acknowledge those, and give you some of those tools to help you with those   * we will try our best to keep the structure of the class in thirds, where I will do some lecturing, we'll bring in a guest speaker, always relevant and germane to the topic, so their discussion will always be reinforcing what we're talking about and giving you some more real world practical insights. So, for instance, today with lior, we'll talk about some of the things we just mentioned.   * and talk about more 0 to one. Some of the things from Peter Thiel's book, as well as how he then scales innovation in a larger organization as he built that company from a small startup to a larger company.   * And then we'll also do some exercises in each class. We'll try to give ourselves at least one exercise every single week for about 20 to 30 min.   * As I mentioned, also very important that all the readings are done ahead of time really helps you participate and make the class a much more engaging place for all of us.   * And, as I also mentioned, laptops will be away notes only. And again, if you have any problems with notebook. Lm, let me know.   * Okay, with that before leor arrives. I'd love to know. Just so I can write down for my own notes. What are some of your expectations now that you've read the syllabus? What are some of the things that you're looking to get out of.   * so that I can tweak our discussions and our future content over the next 5 weeks appropriately for what you guys want.   * and while every year   * I'll do this I have my set slides, my set content. I then go back and I change it, based upon this discussion. So if you don't have anything right now, that's also okay. Send me an email in the next couple of days. I do have to prepare for next week, so don't make it on Thursday, like do tomorrow.   * But I do try to customize every year based upon some of your feedback, and we try to either. Bring in maybe another extra guest speaker. So like last year there was a lot of interest in health and wellness. So we brought in the founder of Strava to come.   * So anything like this? Where, like you have a particular interest? Or maybe there's something like. Also AI was obviously a huge topic. Last year, you'll notice there's an entire, almost entire module now dedicated to innovation in AI. And now we brought in AI founders AI companies to come talk with us. So all of this feedback is super important for myself as well as yourself. Yes, I would be very interested in   * kind of how you strategize for innovation, for different sized companies, like, for example, startups versus consulting companies versus very large corporations.   * So you can always champion innovation. Yep, we will. That's pretty much already covered, but I'll make sure to really reinforce that in particular, to compare and contrast, I think what we probably don't do as much of is like, do a little bit of a recap of like compare and contrast the 2\\. We definitely talk about them. But I'll put a little bit more of a compare and contrast.   * Van. So I like your mention about.   * They need to have like a   * jam for an idea to yep way too long.   * Life and bigger corporations. Yep. So   * I'm curious, because because I'm like leaving through through that   * bars were very broken. So we have this separate thing like innovation contributor, which   * creates ideas brings them to life to a certain level. Yep.   * yep, awesome. We will. We're actually going to talk about that today a little bit. We're going to reinforce it in the module about innovation enterprises. We also have a very dedicated discussion on this topic, but I will tee it up a little bit today and give you some ideas and thoughts on how to do that   * today will be a little bit more about how to do that in a in a larger company, and in within a team. So oftentimes to that, Yvonne. The challenge is, people think, oh, well, my company isn't set up for this. But what I'm going to give you is some thoughts on how to just do it within your own team, start small, start from the ground up, and build up, and I'll tell you some ways that I've done this in a number of different companies and roles   * where I had the same challenge. We ended up like we didn't have a structure in the company to do it. So I just went ahead and did it within our team. And then that sort of like inspired the next team. And the next   * great. Yeah.   * I'd be interested to hear how folks would price these product offerings. So I think something I've noticed is that we have a lot of focus on innovation or this idea, but it doesn't hold water. If we can't make money or break even properly love it, love it. I have a surprise for you. Is that   * next next quarter in our business modeling class that you have all back with me again.   * we have an entire module just on that question of pricing innovation and matter of fact, there's an entire book   * that's a pre-read for that particular class called monetizing innovation. So I'm glad you asked that question one last question, and then we're going to go. Move to our guest, speaker. But please keep them coming. Send me additional emails. If you have thoughts of things that you'd like to have discussed.   * 1 point that I just kind of want to like think about was, how do you balance creating change management and having that be like a vessel for creating innovation versus actually focusing on the development of new product and fighting the balance between running a change management initiative and   * operating product. Yep, love it. We'll make sure to add that in.   * Okay, with that we're going to go ahead and welcome our guest speaker for today.   * We. Fortunately, this is our 1st year where we have our guest Speaker Leora, joining us in person.   * which is pretty amazing. And so, without further ado, I'm going to have lior come up to the front of the class lior, as I mentioned, founder and CEO of Uberfreight lior, and I have known each other for about 15 years. I worked for lior at Motorola   * long time. Good to see you, man, and so in terms of the structure for today, we're gonna have lior. Give you a little bit of a background in terms of sort of his Genesis story, and how he took his business from an idea and concept to kind of 0 to one   * thinking back to the book, and some of the things that you read in those chapters those 1st 2 chapters. So he's going to talk a little bit about his 0 to one journey. And then, as he took a small business and started bringing it into a larger organization. Things changed. You have a small little company, and now you're big of Uber, and you have all these processes to think about. And now, how did he think about innovation   * through that lens? How does he continue to innovate inside of a larger organization. So we're going to be talking about both an innovation, the side of a small startup as well as now as a bigger company, and then me and him will have a little bit of an engagement back and forth. I'll ask him some additional questions, and we'll leave 10 or 15 min for you guys to ask him some questions.   * So you are over to you? Thanks for having me. Yeah. Thank you. Updated his slides. Right? Yeah, yeah.   * Thank you for having me. John is like A,   * and just by the books on the shelf there I see how great of the cost this is, and how relevant in the materials, and this is something that will define the future of the world. So excited to talk about this topic, and.   * as always, I have too many slides in my disposal. So we're gonna do 1520 min of a bit of a story of 0 to 1, 1, 2   * free and stop it free, and then we'll open it up and just talk about stuff.   * And John, and   * we have created amazing products. And we have innovated so much on consumer electronics. But we didn't have a distribution advantage, and we had a grand disadvantage. So for my my next gig, I was determined to find   * the morning and think about what happened in Samsung would do. I can actually come to an industry where I can have like I can be the tech giant. And so I need to look a bit under the hood, and what I found is what many of you might know. Huge industry driving the world economy.   * 1213% of Gdp. Every one of us have. I'm in Chicago. So I'm gonna use the Michael Jordan sort of like weight per day per person move to us like 250 pounds every day for every   * 10 in the United States, and just a huge of almost a trillion dollar economy just in the Us.   * And and all of that is mostly moving on fax phone and paper. If you just like, look what's happening under the hood. And we logistics used to be   * the most exciting job in the fifties. Join the truck, see the wall like, make your middle income, and it's now a job. Nobody want to do the average age for truck driver in the United States was 35, 20 years ago, 45, 10 years ago. 55\\. Now it's basically baby boomers aging out of the industry. Nobody want to be 280\\.   * There is you on the road and not earning great income in restaurant. So you know big capacity, shortage, and then that, and the inefficiency of a trucking just creates a lot of inflationary cost for shippers when you drive around on the highway. And you look at a truck next to you, there's a 40% chance. It's empty.   * 40% of truck manager in the Us are buying basically moving air. So if you take the capacity, shortage, the inefficiency, inherent issues and many other issues in history, what you get is an inflationary force, driving consumer prices up   * to move. This here is actually now, 50% of the cost is the talking electrical   * food. Cpg, 30% of the cost is logistics. So inflationary for social driving issue. And   * that's an issue. So- so that's a bit of the my work about as a good business students. So I'm at Google looking at this opportunity and being excited about it.   * The initial 0 to one innovation advantage I have is   * speed and talent. And what we started to basically start addressing some of that is essentially assembling a small and fantastic to start developing self-driving trucks. This is a self-driving truck in our garage in Palo Alto 9 years ago, and we fundamentally believe that we can take the early   * sort of innings of self driving and apply them into the trucking universe to help some of those pain points to like, bring some better capacity into the market, to help with the capacity shortage, to optimize the network, and of course, to deploy that more safely and do something about all the safety issues that is prevalent on the roads around us. So   * we got going. We assembled great engineers who want to work on problems. They care about the problems they think will have an impact. So there's a lot of like amazing engineers working with Google and test line apple and focusing on passenger cars.   * 9 years ago, when we have shown them the option of actually utilizing the talent to work on tracking the advantage. We had the innovation advantage we had. They started like they saw the opportunity. They saw the potential. They saw the opportunity to do something else, and they saw the opportunity to move fast in a safe way. But fast so.   * and we moved very fast. Within 6 months we've learned some learning. So the way like this.   * Those are not made for trucks. So that's what happened to the residential traffic. Palo Alto, after a couple of back and forth with the truck. But after 6 months we have completed the 1st ever driverless commercial operation in history, and after 9 months we've actually completed the 1st ever paid commercial   * like in history, and moving tens of thousands of the Budweiser wheels in the Colorado highway for Budweiser, which was quite a thing. So we moved very fast.   * And then then 9 months in Google came knocking in the door.   * and that was at the time for one to 2, because it was always apparent that to really scale the technology, you need a lot of capital today. The other thing that was apparent to me as putting my business hat on that while this is super duper, exciting talking now 2,016, it's gonna take, I thought back then.   * 9, 10 years for that commercialize. And and so it's a long ways ahead to really bring all the benefits of the technology and also personally, for me, it's also like a business for that person in training. I can serve pizza   * we are and the engineers for 10 years. So I can go into something useful. So when Google came knocking the door in Chapter 2 was, of course, to continue that on the passenger side within Google, but also go and start a tracking logistics operation. And while we, after we've launched the Budweiser driverless right.   * We had the hundreds of Ceos across. Logistics come to us and tell us about the pain points and the pain points was that. But before that it was they didn't know where the trucks are at.   * They couldn't actually optimize the network. And most of the operation is running on fast forward. So I saw the opportunity   * to start a digital movement. And what we were going after that is to really start   * and freight network. I won't bore you too much on freight. But now let's move to the other side a bit. Just think about it in a very simple way. You have like 1 million cheaper one side. You have a 2 to 4 million truck drivers over that side and to connect them. There's huge friction and inefficiency. Left hand doesn't know what right hand   * is doing. And if you think about tracking as a sort of like a I mean.   * just put a 1 note from like a code to like a driver. You need to do all of those like 55 manual steps I would not bother you with today, and that means about 10 to 15% cost of the transaction is going to just facilitate the transaction. So people are talking like a stock market or any market you want with hundreds of millions of transactions here in the Us. And the friction to execute a transaction is 15% of the cost of that transaction.   * And this is meant for digital transformation and to really connecting both sides with the digital 1st approach. And that's what we set up to do. The freight. Let's globalize freight.   * Let's connect supply and demand at scale. And we fundamentally believe that computers, data science, AI can really bring efficiency or that whole equation both in terms of speed. The transaction can move with the data, and the system can move in the speed of light speed of people, but also in terms of efficiency back to that, like 40% of this empty mind. Because now that optimizing the network.   * let's organize that and really sort of like, organize the Us and globalistic. So that's what we have to do with the power through all of that stuff. That's a good opportunity   * moving from a manual 1st universe to a digital first.st Now, I can say, AI living, we talk about that universe where we can really optimize the entire system in a digital 1st place, and   * the business plan on the napkin was very simple. If we can.   * And if we can automate more of the network, we can achieve 3 things. One, we can lower cost. We can take the 1015% of the transaction and cut it by half.   * Second, we can lower. We can not only lower our cost, we can make those life fails much more efficient. So the computer   * can auto dispatch and optimize the truck driver far more efficiently than anything he or she can do on their own. And we can move. And we have moved the utilization from being 30% empty, which is money not going into the pocket to now network being 10 to 15% empty, which means double the pay of those empty miles. And finally, if we can automate and we can see what the trucks intervene.   * Get ahead of any disruption, then we can actually improve the situation for shippers for customers and drive better service outcomes. So those that's the in a very short, the flywheel. Everyone of those   * low cost.   * lower cost, better service. Get you more demand, more demand, allow you to have more liquidity, more liquidity, allow you to automate more rinse and repeat rinse and repeat rinse and repeat, it's essentially similar to the playbook deployed at scale   * course, the resident.   * And so that's that's what we set up to do. 7, 8 years ago, creating the largest virtual fleet out there with the data science machine met the right rocket the right time, the right price for the right ship and carrier instantly and essentially make logistics a utility that you can consume on demand.   * Everything you need to say about it in any way at any time.   * Never seen one thing.   * There's an action that we do.   * Thanks is this is Angel the great pray, just life   * liberated the taxi situation and all that's gonna limit it to a mathematical equation. You're this close, does it fit your criteria?   * That's not what you do   * as an example, as an example of the-, the pain point and the opportunity for black drive that's like   * and manage the entire day on the app   * much more efficiently, with instant information, with instant pay versus being paid 30 days after. Because we understand exactly what we need to pay when we need to pay, and many, many more innovation we have done over the last 8 years to really, fundamentally transform   * so truly the state of that ownership and the opportunity for people to make a decent living in the profession, and you can see some of the carrier satisfaction. You can see them engaging more and more in the system, finding more and more opportunities, and the output of all of that over the last 6, 7 years is now we have created the largest virtual thing ever did in the history of this industry. But 2 million   * with the day to day operation.   * So that's a bit on the journey. And then again, the the playbook was like, let's create their biggest, the largest virtual fleet   * and tying it a bit back to the innovation in the effort that John has made, you can only accomplish that   * right?   * We don't talk 5 fails, massive network red digitizing the entire supply chain in the United States.   * We can only accomplish that vision. If the brain power we have Google with the technology, we can go and sort of build on Google and with the capital, we can deploy against the problem, and, unlike other marketplaces, the marketplace is one of the way to innovate. And   * so you have enough liquidity in the marketplace, which means some barrier   * where we are now, where we have basically the largest distribution of stock in the United States and everyone on the shoulders of everyone. So   * that was building that the quality and automating all of that back to like those 55 steps, we took that 1215% of friction, and we cut it by half.   * So an average cost of a transaction in the United States to a facility cost like a hundred 2250 bucks. You know that now.   * hey?   * Basically really automating every one of those workflows it. Now that we have the digital.   * we can find it also   * find a lot of feedback from Chicago to La, so we can use them to manage the network. And all of that requires sophisticated machine building. And we think about this is basically running on   * hundreds of millions of node ormutations in a single day, and figuring out what's the best way to collapse them into buttons and into present them to areas in the best way. And again, it's collapsing. The entire manual friction like this is now with other science.   * And   * today has issues driver. In this example.   * we bounce the 1st driver from the road. We send a push to 2 million drivers in this specific facility. Maybe, let's say, a hundred 1,000 drivers to find a new driver. The new driver showed up even before the 1st driver was supposed to be done, deliver the load to the destination, even before it was supposed to live.   * Yeah, to begin with, you expect that from your Google driver. You do not expect that in logistics. So this is driving a much better service outcome for our customers. That again helps   * it it like flywheel, it helps   * great essentially that so 7 years into the journey almost done with chapter 2, basically what we've been. I spoke about the demand side. This is a portion of the supply side with all of those benefits we're going to amass now 7,000 shippers on the network that are happy, happy, big, repeated customers. Fortune 500\\. And that concludes chapter 2, chapter 3\\. It's okay. When I have a 1 and a half day. So   * now we're in (202) 820-2125,   * you pivoted from 0 to one right, if like   * use our speed and innovation and talented self-diving.   * we jump to the next stepping stone, which was like, let's leverage Google, the technology, the brand distribution to build the largest outlet.   * Now let's talk about step number 3, step number 3 always in life. But, like my rule of thumb is, you want to be exposed to the customer, and money follow the money. Who's paying money cheaper?   * How can we be more intimate and more strategic? Aligned with ship, with the customers, with the Ph. Delivery company that was obtained. Money   * as a marketplace. Yeah, great. But you're only doing 1, 5, 10%, Max of shipper supply chain. You have a ceiling on your head, because, as a ship always want to multi source and triple source, and and you'll be able to serve me. But it's a limit on your head of how much, and you can only see a portion of my net   * back to the vision is the vision opportunity. If the vision is transforming logistics. Guess what? There's a ceiling on our head, because there's so much we can leverage to transform if I'm serving 5% of the customer supply chain. So the next stepping stone was like, how can we serve a hundred percent   * of the customer supply chain and-? And to do that, we bought a company called Based in Texas. They are the largest outsource logistics provider in the United States.   * and what they do and what they've done super well is, hey? We will manage all of your logistics on your behalf. We will deploy our technology, we will deploy our people. We will manage all of that mayhem on your behalf, because we can like essentially reduce your logistics cost. Think about it, everybody, you know, cloud in it, the same   * movement that has moved all of those companies to basically put their idea on. The cloud applies to logistics. You can hire the right logistic talent. Even if you grow your subscale, you don't have enough   * scale to actually do it on your own, even if you png. Your trucks are beneficial and sub utilized and subscale because you don't have enough volume, and it's like 1.1% of the market. And by definition logistics will be the last thing your R. And D budget will be on because you focus on your main business and logistics is not your main business. So there's an opportunity here to essentially build   * a logistics cloud that allows all of those shippers to outsource the logistics into the cloud transcripts was the nucleus of that. And that's Chapter 3\\. Now, from a marketplace where we are a bit of at the bottom of the value chain. We are now the most strategic partner of those shippers.   * because they fully outsource their supply chain to us, and now we are the customer to the marketplace. We run the Known and Kellogg, and big portions of Png and Comcast and T-mobile and Bsf. And I can go on and on. We manage   * their supply chain. We show them how we can save them cost. And now we can think about what it does. And putting my technology hat on. Now, we move from universe where we can save 5 using our technology where we can use our technology to really optimize a hundred percent.   * So that's a bit of chapter 3 together. But with that we got a fantastic asset that we have accelerated to no end and and fast forward to today.   * you're looking at the largest logistics network in the United States. We manage now 22 billion dollar of freight under management   * fully end to end services all the way from like really helping those customers claim their entire supply chain to then sort of execute that from the 1st one   * with trucks or late. We have the largest intermodel operation in the United States all the way to the optimize the operation. Who else is all the way now with Google to the last mile, we can help them with the 7 million Uber drivers out there also develop the last mile and go back.   * That's a bit of a company today. Let's talk about the future chapters. Chapter 4, which is, gonna be   * no surprise that anyone uses AI.   * So click, build the largest logistics operation.   * Now it's done. We we have digitized in offline sales interface.   * We now are connected   * every demand source out there, every like, spitting out those orders to every exactly company. Now the fun begins. What can we do? Logistics is inherently and optimization for them.   * How do we fully leverage to drive the next step. So that's what we are very focused on right now, how can we truly leverage them to push and transform logistics? And obviously the 1st one. A place to burn me out is a reducing objects and automating even further so   * and to give you a sense.   * a 25% automation target or cost reduction target, half of it become for analytics. And so we enabled by the end of 25 to reduce the overall cost of operating for freight on a sort of the largest scale out by 12%. 20% of that would be every use case you can imagine. We have now about 5,000 operators in the company.   * Every use case you can imagine. Every 5 screens that an operator is touching will be connected, will be automated, will be together will be moved to the next stage, I would say, that's easy, that's very hard. But a Gen. Is now upon us.   * and we are going to be the leader in logistics, leveraging that. That's like the easy stuff. It's not easy, but it's the hard stuff. But you'll expect us to do that. What I'm excited about is really leveraging to drive supply chain outcome for our shippers, for our customers.   * not just for us. How can we actually change the decision making in logistics using Lm, and what we are starting with is essentially a logistics. So this is the old prototype, but essentially like, Hey, the supply chain. Vp, what do you want to know about your   * great? Well, I have all of your data, so that employment, my transportation management system, with all of your supply chain, just type in chatgpt style. Anything you want to know about your supply chain. A. Who are my best carriers? What are the best? Where do you have a service outage, and why?   * It's now fully in production and- and-, and the 1st step is   * understanding and reason. Right? What's happening? Deal copilot in my network. Tell me so I can speak decision making. This used to take like, 2 to 3 weeks. I'll type my email right? I'll send it to my analyst team.   * Then do the Powerpoint and get it back. In 2 weeks we'll read about it and talk about it, and like doing something enough. We collapse it. Basically, right? Like, I can ask anything, want getting some answers, and then at the speed of decision, making quality of decision making.   * So that's step one step 2 is, let's look at this.   * The Lm. For proactive insights. So that's reactive. Want to know something. Tell me about it. The next is like proactive. Hey, Llm. Unleash myself on the full the no network. And you tell me what are the opportunities when you see you? This is a mock. But say we deployed at about   * several weeks ago, and this is automatically identifying hundreds of opportunities a week for those shippers to reduce their cost.   * You can tweak that lane between Dallas and Chicago by choosing decades. You have an issue with your pickup time in that facility. Here's what you can do, because we know what other 1,000 shippers have done in those situations to improve your on-time delivery, and many, many more examples. And again, this is now moving to a   * empowered decision making where I'm at the human sitting at all. But now I have a the beside me, actively suggesting me what I can do, where what I can do next.   * And then finally, a lot of time. And just like closing this off today, now.   * And so now we have   * 9 years after our story started. And now we have 22 billion dollar of better management, the biggest network. And back to autonomous, the technology is finally upon us. And and that's how   * it's gonna look like that. So the future is hybrid   * where human driver is picking up a load.   * and from the warehouse driving the hard miles in the city to a transfer hub, and next to the highway the robot is waiting there, and the self driving truck is taking from the side of the highway from the transfer hub all the way to the other side. (520) 520-0500 miles autonomously. It's like a rail of wheels without a driver   * going all the way the other side of that autonomous lane. And there is another local driver waiting, doing a trailer switch and delivering all the way to the destination.   * win-win for everyone. The local drivers, human drivers, are staying much more utilized, and they can stay local, and they can stay next to their family those very long miles. And, to begin with, less and less people want to do can be automated and and together, it's really sort of like the hybrid model of the future.   * It's not future. This is a reality today. So we are now doing about 20 autonomous notes a week in Dallas, San Antonio in Dallas Houston   * A. There's a driver in the cabin supervising, not touching the wheel, for now in April 1st   * believe that it's actually launching.   * and the driver goes up. And so we are now preparing for the 1st fully driverless commercial, recurring deployment of driverless capacity in April. And and basically the   * the plan is to leverage. Now, now we have the network. We don't always provide it.   * Now we have 4 or 5 of those autonomous developers on our network. We are the best place for them to go in   * deployed autonomous assets and live presentation, and and we are starting here   * in April. Then, by end of next year. I think this will be always so, driving all the way to El Paso and then starting to go into Phoenix. That's probably gonna be the 1st few lanes in the next 1218 months, and in the next 3, 4 years you should expect to see all of those blue being autonomous again. Aspect, going back to our all today, we bring the demand   * for those guys. So we have basically 500 shippers line up. You see, some of those numbers waiting for the holiday try and waiting to deploy commercial drivers operation, and you'll expect to see that model of those deployed at scale in the next day. 2 or 3 years reproduction value will only come in.   * So yeah, it's a closing the full loop. And the last thing I'm excited about self driving is unleashing on physical AI logistics. So   * yes.   * a question which of those which of those frames you think are real versus like generated   * today? Again, what else fail? Alternative.   * the ordinary. So everything here is simulated and generated in the machine. And basically the new approach for self driving is fails   * where the models are learning the physical world, acquiring all of those objects with the sensors and basically training the driver in the simulator on endless permutation. And most of the training is now being done in those simulated environments that really accelerates the development time and deployment times. This is one of the startups that we are working with. With. This allows you to do is you can   * great scenarios. I can have construction zone. I can mimic a left, turn a right term blend, can put a counter. I can play with the weather conditions and whatnot. It's like, really accelerates the pace of learning. And that's a bit on sort of what's happening nowadays. That's it. Yeah.   * 1,200 folks here, including some great technologies on the team. And yeah, thanks for having me   * have questions for you.   * So what I wanna ask is, as you went from small smallest team, 50 guys   * that are all working on this in one warehouse in Ss, you moved into bigger space team grew to.   * I mean 1,200.   * How do you now manage those teams to give them the space to think about what's next? So   * you- you have obviously can't distract them from the stuff that's right in front of them. The okay, ours for next quarter next, you know this year. But how do you give some separation to those people to kind of go off and explore some of those other things that you   * yeah, dame.   * 1st of all, I think we all thrive on context to innovate, we need to understand the domain. That's why point that you can't innovate without fully understanding the context environment. So   * one thing is like, especially in logistic numbers. I wasn't like operating in the warehouse. So to really understand, especially between the context. So we are investing a lot of time in sharing the context   * concept like bringing customers in talking with them, having a flow of information back to the teams, sharing the strategy, sharing the constraints, sharing the opportunities. If you don't have contacts, then nothing on top.   * Second, I focus on the big enablers like in In for the big big needle movers. I don't believe you can like somehow magically happens bottom up if it can happen bottom up. But you have to   * amplified. So the biggest, I mean think about what the name is, all of those innovations that you saw the blend, the brand right? We   * what will be along for the ride. And once now we have to put in our back. Everything is easier, right? And we have enabled a driverless ecosystem. Now that we have that   * everything is easier. So- so like   * arranging the strategic pieces. So everyone's like much better in a much better position.   * That specifically on your question, I think it's a   * probably more, 70, 30, 70 will be on the next 6, 12 months, and it's very execution oriented, and then 20 to 30 will be on the 12 to 36 months. You will have more space. But I don't believe it is like innovation team. Every team Intel   * chateau has the core and has the next one here, and I don't. I don't believe personally like putting some team, you know, a separated so they can think about the future. The the thinking about the future starts by understanding today and being connected to reality. So it's about like giving the existing team enough space. So they can actually do that. And and we   * budget. So in every 5%, 1530\\. And this is how where we're gonna create space. I don't necessarily know   * what everything will happen with the 20%. But I know the areas   * how to create a space. Last example is on AI, and then to set this up, basically the company for the next jump. There, we have asked everybody keyboards off like hands off the keyboard, and we set up like 2 days for training, not just to the engineers and the for a lot of the operators as well. And we create, like a a mixed.   * a 55 different teams between operating sales, commercial and- and technology. So they can actually sort of hack on stuff together and create a lot of those.   * All right, let's open up some questions from all of you.   * Let's start.   * Oh.   * 1st of all, thank you for sharing. This is actually pretty cool, I mean, read a little bit about group rate, but not- not, I think, just show seeing the evolution of   * are you started from? Where you are today is pretty impressive, I guess my question for I'm wondering is that   * are you and your team, thinking beyond just trucks and thinking about   * like airplanes and ships, because when I think of logistics, I feel like trucks is the only is only a subset of the logistics industry as a whole. How are you thinking about innovating in those other spaces as well? Yeah, I think someone is like understanding what's for and what's in   * what's your core advantage? Because what's a bit of a stretch? I think our advantages transportation. Given the optimizing transportation network and software giving. We're a technology company, and we can do so much on the optimization side. So we stay close to that. That means we will optimize everything that moves on the road to see us optimizing with software and offering capacity, big trucks, small trucks.   * That's the focus, ocean and air. We don't have anything to offer the capacity. It's a highly, highly so. If   * one of those companies I mentioned, when have Internet visibility of the container from China all the way to the port in the late. And what's happening to that when it closes the dock and goes on the road and offer that Internet visibility. But the focus is on transportation, and if you look at the spend, most of the spend is actually on the transportation. So we think we have, like a 10 year opportunity ahead of us, but really focus   * in the back.   * Yeah, so Uber's suite of autonomous trucks kind of be seen as their expansion into providing like carrier services. Do you see Uber moving forward into, you know. Say, expanding into maybe that last mile delivery to compete with companies like Fedex and ups.   * That's it. Again, Gotcha, potentially.   * Let's think about geolocation.   * and you make sure you have a competitive advantage. And what you think you can execute   * most of delivering all the packages. You see, if you have the increase of   * $8 apiece, $7 apiece.   * And well, let's say 70% of them is the last mile driver.   * But we're gonna have 10 million of those right that can they can bring to bear.   * But, like the further set of the process to minimize now has the densest.   * And   * so it's a domain where, if we choose to go there, we can bring both the most economy, which I think it puts in a great position to potentially go down, not to mention you have   * the demand network with those. Now give you one last one of the total optimization is our package   * where we can help them optimize their entire last mile packages and figuring out where to inject to Ups and Fedexps, and how and what not. We are running for that 250 million packages a year now.   * So you have the demand. We have the middle mind. We have the last mile. I think it's an area of definitely exploration and something that we're really looking into potentially, can we add value today?   * One more question.   * yeah, can you please talk a little bit more about like the pivots and conversations we're having with Uber before. And then, after acquisition, you started out retrofitting semi trucks right to make them autonomous.   * And then and then it kind of became well, Uberfy, using kind of like Uber magic platform for for logistics, which is related, but also very different. And now it sounds like you're you're using   * other autonomous technology. Now, now, I guess yeah, what was going on behind the scenes.   * Yeah. So, as I mentioned, I think life for me is a bit about stepping stone. So stepping 1 1 was surviving surviving is how to develop things.   * If you want to know, I call it the more particular millions of dollars to actually get, not on the finish line. Something right   * at the time   * again. For me it was very clear that the more sustainable long term position to be is the network operator, software provider versus the capacity stuff. Some of it is like based on my days with John, and then end of the day in in autonomous. It's gonna be a long day. But in the end of the day.   * And once you have 2, 3, 4, and did this with Jim and John and the consumer electronics industry. Once we have, like a couple of other products competing. It's a bit of a risk for the bottom, the value they lies in.   * What are you solving for customers? And how do you actually change the outcome. And I thought 10 years ago a very strategic position key is on the network side, getting closer to the customer. And that explains some of that.   * this app as marketplace to bring shippers and people together already. So you had a you kind of started that network already. So it wasn't like that was brand new from Uber. You started incubating that   * before about it. We started doing the baby steps, and then, whenever opportunity came that allows us to charge, and someone's like such. To be honest, listening to listening to customers.   * I have psychology. In fact, they descended on talking industry like what the heck has just happened, and every in the industry came within a span of like 8 weeks to tell me all of the problems in life, and by the end of that, I was like, Wow, like this, digital stuff   * is so painful for them. And it's now it's not like 9 years. So I was very motivated like, okay, let's lead it to that pain point and see what?   * Alright.   * Thank you so much.   * We're a little behind. So let's try to get   * back here at like 20\\. So it's like 5, 6 min real quick. Bio, get some copy. I'm back here at 22,   * 5, or 6 things   * right? It's the language.   * Okay, right?   * Think so, too. But it's gonna cost.   * Did anybody else have that problem?   * Oh, my God\\!   * Oh, okay, yeah, wow.   * October.   * Oh, cool.   * Don't worry.   * Oh, it's not bad, man, and that's not like.   * you know.   * it's not up a joke that's a 3 kids.   * What's my background?   * Here's the same   * we're at   * on Monday. So yeah, man, she's just growing. So she just hit that 8 pound mark so we can put her in.   * Sometimes things work out everything. So far, this is the 1st variable that we're adding into it, because, like, I mean, you know, when it's early baby time, it's like none of this matters. Exactly.   * So. Yeah, this is the only infrastructure that we're kind of.   * Briefly back to work in January acting.   * Thank you.   * Yeah.   * that's pretty much what I said   * so many things.   * But back to my point. So   * right, that's a huge challenge. And with the market becoming more more globalized and R\\&D becoming more globalized when I was learning   * team like 2 engineers in every country wanted to map their country. But how do you actually schedule differently?   * Yeah. Yeah.   * Hi, there\\! My name's Jamie. I had a question about your autonomous vehicle. So I know that   * you can do that   * to what we were chatting about just prior to that.   * The 1st one is just thinking about all of the various elements of innovation that we were talked about that weren't just.   * Certainly that was sprinkled in.   * but things like the ability to pay the drivers instantaneously versus 30 days like that. One thing in itself   * probably changed a big way of some of their drivers, and how they thought about using the business, and why they work with with great the importance of Brand.   * How important was he couldn't even just do this by himself. He could accelerate that innovation so much faster with the help of a bigger brand. The importance of talent, talent, acquisition, the right talent, and the reason to reinforce the why to motivate the talent behind it. The domain expertise the phase, separation within the squads underneath. So, instead of having a completely separate R\\&D group. What he does is creates many different R\\&D,   * he spins them off within the teams, separates them out. So 70% of the budget now, and resource allocation is on like the franchise here and now, and 30%, he said, is on like horizon 2 and horizon. 3 separated out, dedicated, budgeting for that. And, interestingly enough, he percolates that across all of his teams versus having just one team around it. But the principles remain   * space separation, and what was great about it, implicit trust and knowledge transfer back in because they're in the exact same team. It's not this other team in left field. It's actually in all of those teams. So a lot of what we were just talking about   * really reinforced through that conversation with lior. What else? In terms of like the 10 types of innovation that you read through Keeley? What are the other types of innovation? Elements that he touched on that stuff.   * They're on experience mostly. Yeah, I just kind of thinking about   * you're improving the experience for not just even the driver. But every person that's involved throughout the process. That was, that's the one thing that stuck out for me.   * else configuration management.   * We are using AI to like efficiently profit model bi-wheel   * that fly. That's a fabulous example of his flywheel. I don't know about you guys, but I love his flywheel example really got me thinking about some things as well what I'd like you guys to think about with that flywheel is really, think, as you work through your capstone projects. Think about your version.   * Really, really important. It's this like looping cycle that creates more demand helps. This market reduces their costs, and in turn creates more demand. It may just be a flywheel. His is very much   * operationally driven. Yours might just be demand. You know how you use a flywheel to drive more demand of your users, whatever it may be, but really think through that flywheel approach for your capstones. And as you saw with limor like, he started with a technology solution self driving. And that is certainly not   * what the core of Uber freight is today. And and if he was just to stick with the P type innovation, the product or product system innovation. He didn't have a durable business that could thrive. He had to look at those 10 types of now. He didn't know this. He didn't. Necessarily, I don't think he.   * He's just a great entrepreneur and innovator, and this is what you will see is   * the really great innovators and business drivers   * implicitly build upon Keeley's 10 types of innovations. And as you think about your capstone projects, really think about that, you're probably right now, focus a little bit more on the.   * But as you mature, that start thinking through all those other aspects, whether it's service and experience, the configuration profit model, whatever that may be, there's a couple of other things that he really kind of stood out to me, which was   * sort of the self healing and the service aspect of it. So it's like, once they had all the data, it did all this other stuff. It started to unlock more and more and more. So even the data itself became and allowed them to. Actually they couldn't have actually acquired that one company at the end, like his phase, 3\\. Without 1st building the trust of servicing those customers like just kind of builds upon itself.   * and he still has focus like ultimately, the job to be done is very clear for him, and they stay true to that, and they've kept some focus. Certainly it's evolved over time, but on a very, very thoughtful, and I'm gonna say, predictable but thoughtful trajectory. And so when you think about like the why   * and think about for your own capstone like, why do you exist really? What is the bigger job to be done for your capstone, business or project or product. It will help you start to think about where that business or where that product can go next.   * instead of just saying, we are a self driving company. That's not what uberfreight is. It's not a self that's where it started. But what he ended up doing, stepping back and asking why? Why? Why? Why? Talking to his customers? And realized, actually, we're not a self driving company.   * That's not. That's part of what we do.   * But ultimately we're solving a bigger logistics problem for them. And that led more of his roadmap, and where they evolved still with the focus of transportation and trucking, which is what you heard when you asked like, are we going to go beyond that? No, they know that is their competitiveness. That's where they have permission to play. That's where they built their expertise. That's where they build the competency. You still have to have focus. And I'm glad, he still said that because it remains very focused.   * Then a little bit nervous, actually did start saying about planes.   * But he is keeping that focus and knowing where that focus is where you have permission to play and built up that competitive   * advantage around the talent and the domain expertise that was really really important to to highlight.   * So with all of that, and I will reference a lot of what   * Leora was talking about. The next. Really lecture for today is going to be what we call them the pillars of innovation. You can think of these as really like the enablers.   * and we are going to use these and reinforce them through all of our lectures in the next 5 weeks. And so it's really good just to sort of reinforce these. But these will be the enablers, the foundational scaffolding for how we think about innovation, and they will come in various forms through the lectures. As we move forward.   * As I mentioned, we are going to be talking about both small and large enterprises. So this will be certainly a point in our future lectures, because we will see a variety of different ways in which these pillars are implemented. For instance, the way in which you recruit and manage talent in a small company dramatically different than how you're going to do in a larger company? And so we'll definitely make sure that as we continue through the 5 weeks we reinforce the differences.   * And so with these, we're going to get right into them. 1st is going to be around culture, leadership and structure, these 3\\. And I think pretty much all 3 of these things we just got done talking about in lior's discussion. The 1st let's talk about the power of culture.   * and this the sense of thought. It started off with him, really making that important, because what you heard from him was the best engineers want to work   * on the biggest problems that make the biggest differences. And that means   * really started on an incredibly powerful story in that, in a small organization as well as big organization   * as you recruit talent, it's almost as important to pitch them like they were an investor. Matter of fact, when I hired my earliest employees, I used my investor pitch deck to everyone.   * I pitch them because they are putting a risk into my business. They are putting their time into this. They are making an investment. It's not a monetary investment.   * a time investment. It's a social capital investment, whatever this thing is sideways, they're making an investment. So being able to treat them just like an investor helped me with this, just like it did New York. And when I refer to teams at Google just the same, you're always competing, even in a bigger company for the best capital.   * And so it was really, really important that we always start with one   * really start to reinforce us with our teams and build this solution   * of really, why do we exist? What are the problems we're trying to solve? And even if you're, you know, in a large organization, and you don't feel that that really exists in the larger work. You just start   * start building that culture document, start building those values with your team   * joined my team. I saw a number   * well at large has some really great type of ways in which they think about innovation. But I just want to join my team about 400 people.   * I was not very happy with how that team had been structured. I was part of a larger organization, so I just took it upon my own squad, my own team. I had about a hundred people.   * and I just said, No, yes.   * this is an area I'm worried about. I can't change everybody back to change management start small. We're gonna write a values document. We're gonna start meeting.   * And sure enough, as soon as we started doing this. About 6 months later other teams started seeing the doc started to see how we reacted like that's really great. We love that. We want to do something similar. Share your doc with us. Then it expanded, expanded, expanded.   * and before we knew it, like the way in which we approach that was not adopted by the entire team. And so that didn't come in because I just said like, Hey, I want to go get this done from a leader. But I use my team to do that   * from the ground up. So even if you're in a larger organization, you're having struggles   * today, start locally, start small and start to build that culture. How you want to see in terms of innovation   * the answer to that.   * Why, the next is going to be champions.   * We were mentioned himself like, Hey, the stuff that really needs to have like push forward like he gets involved with direct   * the top of the chain, or somewhere in the top of the chain. We need to sponsor some of these.   * They won't get done without some type of sponsorship.   * Certain organizations will have implicit structures that offer this, they'll have a general manager structure at Google. They really lean into this idea of a general manager.   * And so   * this is probably not the same type of thinking that you will think about general manager in the sense that, like, they don't always necessarily have sales teams involved. But a general manager is responsible for engineering design product and allows them to really shift something suitable.   * And so you don't have these functional words inside of you have, like a product or an engineering word and a software where you don't have these different functions. They're all percolated throughout the organization. And so within a product area or product group, you'll have many engineers, many.   * no, just one. And so this allows them to have essentially executive champions   * that run these products that give that champion structure. And that's how Ben gave brain inside of that structure itself. And motorola. They didn't have that structure. We had to build. This idea of a champion really didn't exist. And so we had to really build that. And so when I pitched that motormaker project   * we were, and I had to make that argument for this structure like this won't be successful. We can go off and do this and keep all these teams in their silos, and we'll fail yet again. Their time to fail on this, we need to build a champion structure.   * one person that's ultimately accountable at the right level that can have all of the functions or many of the functions, maybe not all, but many of them that are responsible for shipping. This thing   * all focused on one mission to one person, and that person can then tear down   * obstacles and lockers that they may have, and they're appropriately leveled at the right.   * We're not too senior.   * They're not too good. It's kind of the Goldilocks for that spotlight   * the next one. And and we're going to talk about some organizations that have gotten this wrong in a second.   * The 3rd is that organizational structure.   * There's no set way. Google has different ways in which they do it. At Moda. We've done it different ways. We did it different ways. But ultimately what I have seen. What I have observed in my own research is that almost all of the best performing organizations that innovate have some sort of phase, some sort of phase, separation.   * and an organizational structure that has some type of dedicated   * budget dedicated resourcing. You hear the word budget. It's resourcing people. It's dedicated people that are focused on. Why the tour appropriately   * and the reason why this anytime in which you try to make this everyone's problem.   * It's you   * make that.   * It's really 2 things that I see happen. Let's create an R\\&D group and an animation group. Let's hire some people from the outside. What happens when this happens?   * Totally disconnected? I see this happen like so many times, so many organizations. What are the people? It's like the the legacy engineers. What do they think is happening?   * Yeah, fine.   * because they feel like they should have been put in that position.   * I'm not good enough what the fuck.   * We've got the best engineers here. We can't be trusted 15 years from there.   * So like that pretty much never works. They kind of go create this new group, that's all built up people from the outside and Innovation group. And they have their own building. That's super fancy, and has all the new interior and stuff like this.   * And and the same thing works when we make innovation, everybody's problem. And it also becomes no one's problems, everyone not going out of business.   * And so if my manager and my director is like, Hey, we're late on shipping this thing. We need more resources.   * Like, I have dedicated people, and I'm just like supposed to dedicate 30% of my time. Everyone dedicates 30% of their time. It means that we're gonna call that back   * like every team I've seen will always move to people because you're always lean on something, or you need more people, or whatever it is. And you're like, oh.   * what kind of a fan   * that that's gonna be a push on. We're gonna get you back over here and stop all that fun stuff that 20% project. Yeah, go, put that on just constantly for better, it's always happening.   * And so you never really had that dedicated focus and energy. And so this organizational structure is so important. So to have some type of data separation to ensure the dedicated capacity to think about that kind of horizon. 2\\. Horizon, 3\\. Type of thing   * within Google.   * we lots of different types of out like forward thinking groups. But even within the teams, we've been also will separate resources.   * So within my organization. What we found was, it was very difficult for us within the wearable software team within Android to start. We were always like trying to ship the next.   * It was like next release of Android, the next release of Android. And what would happen is like the really cool, awesome features   * needed more time. They couldn't get done in one release, and because the incentive structures were always based on something you shipped like you got promoted, based on something you ship people started narrowing down and watering down the innovations to only fit into what could get shipped in that fund. Release cycle   * incentives for all of you.   * One was structured in this like, let's shift. The next thing we had to break out of that cycle. So the 1st thing we had to do was start to build separation, take some resources and put them only working on these things.   * And you guys, we're gonna put this group of people together. You focus in on some of these features that might take 2 or 3 releases. We can start out now.   * So start on 6\\. Now and then we put all the functions in those groups. It's just an engineering group. It wasn't just a design group wasn't just a product. Managers across the country and design.   * They all were in a spot together, or dedicated to exploration on like the next release or the next 3 weeks. And we've also done how to add in compensation and incentives because   * the overall incentive structure is based on shipping stuff.   * Well, they're not shipping stuff for maybe 2 or 3 years. So we have to address that incentive which I also put into organizations.   * So I put this all sort of in the group of like culture and structure, of like digging through incentives, digging through the structure, creating the space separation   * just as important as that separation. If you have that separation too far as we talk about these innovation groups.   * executive builds like you. Take that face separation   * with all of these things, you take it to our leadership and champions who can take too far. You can have taken so far that they have what's called in Lucia's book, the Moses Trip.   * Moses trapped the first, st the difficult figure Moses leads the Israelites.   * This idea that one person sort of is the bestowing of the vision, and only that one person can lead only that one person. So the organization falls. Trap to. Only this person is the anointer of what's good or what's bad? What's the new innovative thing, what's not? And so you need to think through how to make sure that we are inspiring lots of champions, not just one champion, but lots of champions   * across the organization a moment. Where are people taking them? Too far?   * Culture same thing. And Chan had a culture that ended up being legal, that they ended up just suing people.   * They've been not gonna be.   * And so all of these things can be taken too far, or bastardized or twisted. So we just have to keep in mind what they are really meant to find that Goldilocks Zone for them to ensure that we don't have any separation. Let's say in organization   * that people have all sorts of. And in those groups what's important is we do have. And it's okay. It's okay to have a fixed return. That's not your jam. That's okay. Many organizations do have them by pointing out that those groups are inherently evil or bad   * is that they need to have a dynamic equilibrium to bring that information back in and out, back. So they're working on real business problems that exists don't have time to get to   * necessarily mean things are so far that they're it's still some focus.   * Most of the times that I've seen work best. They're taking people in from the franchise business. So they're building trust and linkages back with maybe the old timers. Some of these people that have been with the company for a while. Their culture leaders get transplanted and build rotations in. So they sit inside of the research board that are indeed work, so that they have linkages, informal linkages back in, so that when those teams come back and present they bring something back in.   * they are coming to contrast inheritance, and also making sure the incentives are there, so that the research arm has an incentive to keep a bench.   * So if they have said, listen, if you guys come up with ideas all the time and they never ship.   * it's not gonna work. You're not gonna get your phone.   * Somebody inside a missing business to have a sponsorship.   * probably 3 different research projects in my teams. They were in a completely separate room, right? But they were incentivized to ship stuff. They want to ship stuff. They don't want to sit and think about it all day long. And so we worked together on a number of projects where we could accelerate some of their events into products very, very, very rapidly and quickly, where they don't have to get bogged down.   * We'll take that feedback, and we have the incentive on our side to reach out. So we would get incentivized and our product managers, our engineer team would get like an incentive and credit in their performance reviews   * for working with the mind of his research research needs to be applied.   * Incentives were working with some of the core businesses. So all of these things were great tools that cut down the Scripture.   * So where did these go tomorrow?   * The one that I'm gonna talk briefly about here is marketing anyone know anything about?   * We're the 1st to innovate for windows on, not windows. Microsoft, like windows on   * or came up with, like the graphical user interface. They did not.   * 0\\.   * No one knows that. That's the problem.   * They never commercialized that they were out in left field. They had this separate building   * from the east coast. They put these people on the West coast, and I tell you what they came, I mean the same ideas.   * Amazing technology is none of are ever used relationally.   * And so this is where faith, separation went wrong. They had no incentive structure, no operational structure to actually commercialize anything they were doing. It was purely just a R. And D.   * Look at the exact type of room when I joined it in like 2,000.   * It has this motorola mask.   * And this is where that space separation goes wrong   * and parents. It has a ton of ideas on great technology. It never could build that dynamic equilibrium   * to figure out the transfer of those from what the book in the chats calls from artists.   * and the solution   * idea of artists being some of the people we all can be involved with. These things aren't like you are only one or the other. It's a mindset of how I operate in a given set of circumstances. But I'm going to operate with the half of the artist. So I'm going to focus a little bit more on the future, and I may take a role that for now I'm focused on being the song   * like, I don't have the time and money to think about problems like 3 years down the road. I can only think about the problems from like   * 12 months or less like that's all I could really focus in on. But this idea of highly competitive artist in a little music.   * Okay, next is user.   * We are really talking.   * Which was like, Hey, he bought the self driving trucks was like.   * I know you started bringing in all of these customers   * into the warehouse to look at their real quote Biz Bay and stuff trends from.   * and they all told them, I got a lot more problems that are more critical to my business.   * And this, like you said, like, it looks like   * it was so important. And what happens oftentimes in any work is a lot of people are typically then wrapped up and like shipping the next feature or writing the prd, and maybe they get some budget for some research.   * Make sure that you're talking to customers involved and mitigating some tips.   * I do this   * but this importance of being super close to the customer. And what you think might be the problem.   * And you're looking for the problem needs to be solved behavior.   * And what we have been working on.   * hey?   * They were.   * It's their name, wow\\!   * And other entities.   * That's opportunity.   * And he was smart. He spoke.   * It's like, let's go focus on that we'll get back this other time later. But like, let's focus on the   * so   * big cultures organizations, they'll say things that allow them to find us. But it's how they really live up to it. Disney, I think, is probably the the most well known of this of where they have instilled in their culture. Of these magical moments.   * Your customer delay.   * Google will say, respect the user that's ingrained in anyone's head that has ever worked at Google or works at Google, respect the user, respect the opportunity, respect each other, and they make sure of that through pretty much everything they do. You go through a product review. It's about respecting the user. These things are checked in on it's ingrained inside of Amazon customer obsession.   * They start with a Prf a team. Anyone ever work at Amazon.   * alright Amazon's products. It starts off with a press release that you as the product manager, right? You write   * press room right here about how it's gonna work for your customers who your customer is, how the customer.   * That's how they start entry point.   * They start eating.   * That's the type of tools and culture that gets ingrained about customers.   * another is around, how do we implement the call center headquarters   * like one week for a year in zoom.   * So regardless of level, you're a know it's 1 week a year. You have to go into a store and help run the store. And   * it's gonna be a wonderful, wonderful way to keep people focused on doing it. And sometimes you just have to give people the permission to do it and carve out space at a time. Build it as an okay, you're a team leader, or you become a team leader like, make this an Okr, make this a goal, build the incentive to have your people do things like   * whether it's go sit with customer service people take some calls. They're getting a store, whatever it may be.   * Make sure that we're prompting the customers all of the time   * at Geo. Fit. What we end up doing is instead of having research projects. We did it every week, every single week. We would refer customers we didn't yet know what we were going to talk about. We'd have a back. So product manager in the Us. Would just contributes like, Hey, this is the thing that's on my mind right now. Just fit it right into the next session. We've got 5 customers coming in tomorrow. Every single week. We've had customers coming in   * evergreen. So one project. It's an evergreen project. We just had a backlog of stuff that we put in front of them   * always talking to people, and then we would share that out every week.   * Happy to get a digest of like what the customers were talking about that particular.   * It's at Google. We have the same structure with my team. We didn't do it every week. We did it, I think, once every week.   * So we do a little bit more planning, a little bit more recruiting for it, but about every 3 to 4 weeks we would have   * 20 customers come in, and you just have.   * Excuse me everything. Once you get something   * and product managers and the entire, you know. Session.   * I would say, that's enough to be fair, I think like, really, if we should be doing this every single week.   * and I'd be talking to customers closing them out. It forced me to learn all of our internal operations forced me to learn what customer issues are having. And behold, I would find problems all the time.   * things that we could use in the time.   * and may be forced me to be very comfortable.   * doesn't require an executive at your company to make these things happen.   * I have a very, very strong point of view on this that these things involve in our life done when they're bombed.   * be quiet, and then we'll go out to   * Tours and shippers. Get a lot of priority within a company.   * If you can lead by example, I can guarantee this will start to be inspiring to others, and then start, dignify your example.   * And so the 1st one is just that math of that mantra. Think about our Amazon   * and this idea of evergreen discovery, whatever is within your budget whatever you can possibly do.   * If you don't have the budget to go off and have your team or yourself bring people in.   * Do you have other ways to do it. It doesn't take a lot of money.   * You can go use your own Crm system, gets $1 gift cards like   * you can- you can do all sorts of things pretty easily and talk to customers. And one of my companies before we would actually do a lot of this just through social media. We would just go in and talk to people, give comments.   * So if they put a comment on an ad boom, they're interested enough. But a comment on an ad that's probably   * so anything you can do on evergreen discovery, having yourself for your people's home   * and spending every single week, if possible.   * The next idea, like global rotation. So like table does this with their executive teams.   * we did this. Oftentimes we would take people and put them into. And so we'd make sure that, like our customer discovery, people bring in customer service and actually sit in the meetings with us. We bring customer service in some of these sessions. We would take some of our customer service people and bring them into some   * social. Give them some flexibility. We also   * the time where we force people. I think it was like one day a month.   * They had to work as a customer service.   * Just so they can understand the issues that people are having.   * and then they would see oh, I mean everything. Every single time as an advocate they got covers. It   * can solve this with like a script, or whatever it was, they always took something from it that was never enough to like a huge feature, but was like a serious problem.   * Here. I could build this in like 2 h.   * we just onward with the customer.   * This is becoming so easy to do now with agents and Llms, where you can just go into your company doesn't already do this like you have an example to lead here and just go do it for your team.   * You can use no clue control very quickly. Also trying to use to do this where you can just start scraping surfing data on the map.   * even if it's not your automated   * customers that like are into a smart. Maybe they're not using it or aren't. But they're potential customers.   * You can give prompts to define. And just this data, summarize it for your team   * immediately and have all of this stuff available. Summarize it, distill it and put it in   * Oftentimes, team video chat. Also at any time.   * I think it's really important for you all. Just really think about what are those outcomes over the outputs   * and making sure that, as you have performance reviews with your teams. You are all here because you want to be the next leaders. If you have leaders already, that's where you're going to be and making sure that your teams are focused on the outcomes. What did this actually mean? I don't want to hear that you did all of these things. You were here all night long. You ship all this stuff.   * What problem did it solved? And how do you   * in any prd, everything we do?   * Number one problem is with the customers, no problem.   * So we can focus our team on   * another is customer advisory board. So this is very common in Saas businesses   * where they wanna bring in a bunch of potential domain expertise from particular customers and talk to them in a control setting but level of up into like an executive level. So they want to move it from, let's say, developers. And they want to bring it up to like decision makers to understand their customers and how they make their decisions, not just problems there, but how they make decisions and how they solve them. So also a really easy and great thing to do.   * either. It doesn't have to be discord. But like some type of community where you can bring your customers together, is incredibly powerful. Source ideas, innovation and problems.   * whether that's like Facebook group discord community, like whatever it is. If you do not have this good product.   * building is bold old hire someone to moderate it.   * Go to Egypt. Come, see, I'm carrying how.   * and we hate it to the moderate.   * You will uncover so much gold here and have your product. Managers go in and like consumption.   * just go there and respond to some of the questions and issues customers are having. Not only will it build evangelists and people just go up and talk about your product. But you're getting just   * these are the people that are doing. These are the people that are telling everybody else. Tell everybody   * that is like so strong, even if not   * because they understand totally. These are actually just talking to people.   * And then the last issue that I mentioned is pretty customer support.   * They're a smaller business.   * every kind of like major release cycle we're bringing them in. We invited them into all of our customer discovery sessions. That's okay as well.   * And then bringing, that is, gonna get just building that culture of getting people to   * clarity, vision and freedom.   * We already said this pretty clear on the importance of this reason why bringing that brand into play   * about this like frankly recruiting?   * Okay   * to your roadmap. Why do we exist, and just repeatedly keep communicating where they maybe have different opinions on it.   * And so it's really. And it's really important, then, to understand how I ladder up into a bigger mission? Or how do I make the bigger outcomes and decisions in   * the entire way that they think about the program   * corporal is like the lowest level person volunteering.   * There you go.   * My lady was in the Vietnam War when the army came in. Unfortunately it's like the worst.   * It changed a bunch of how the Army thought about how to operate some well techniques that happened in Iraq. It was the marine forest version of   * unfortunately, it creates a lot of pressure, and unfortunately, whether I am   * 1 million different century their attention.   * They tried to figure out why this happened. What can they do to change.   * and what they really realized is that the lowest level person was so disconnected from the water   * that they were just executing the mission without asking you any questions. The only question was like, Ask you. We don't want anyone to ask.   * Do what you learn. Don't ask any questions, and they put that on its head, and they wanted to make a strategic one.   * making sure that we have the why, why we're doing this mission. Not that they have to do a submission   * every briefing before they collected from their needs, and why commissions?   * Why they were there so that they can make the right decisions in place where they were to ensure that they know. Taking down that door while in their mind they're executing on that mission. They understand the greater impacts of that that undermine the entire country.   * It's so important to understand that. Why think about that for your own organization? How do you bring that? Why, that clarity, vision and brand in that you're hiring and everything that you do across the innovation   * focused. I mean, this seems clear. But like, even with your like, you need to have focus. It's really also easy to get distracted. So it's really critical to think closely about that. Why and the job to be done.   * We started in my company in Geobit, thinking that our business was around location service. That's where we start like, hey, these parents are having problems attract their kids. All this stuff. And so like our mission is to build the greatest and most innovative location system.   * And as we started to ask ourselves like why, and we started to really kind of fine tune. The the reason for us existing and end up being really more of what we're trying to do is just deliver peace of mind like take away the anxiety, so like location services. Just a way to do that. But it would be too limiting to our roadmap, which is a location service. So what is the bigger problem? They're having the bigger problem they're having   * of being a parent being a parent   * constantly free. And so that led us to think through other types of solutions and other types of businesses of where we could expand our particular product line, but within a still a focus of like servancing the customer on this idea of peace of mind. That's what ended up leading us to eventually be acquired by life. 360\\. Because once we started asking ourselves this question.   * we're like, Oh, well, like, we could actually start building solutions around insurance. And all these other lines of business that are also about peace of mind.   * And it just happens to me right now. The worry is here really, like, you know, peace of mind could go even earlier in life, like when they're in the crib. I'm worried about them like potentially having sids peace of mind as they get psychology. So as we started to think about this, we started to think about other businesses that were essentially playing in our same focus area. They weren't shipping the same product. But we were all solving similar problems of peace of mind. So we started talking insurance.   * I start talking to baby monitoring companies start talking to the people like like 3 60, and we weren't competing at the time.   * But I knew that we all shared the same problem, and so by doing so, not only did I learn a lot about similar problems that we're solving. And they didn't worry about sharing that information because we weren't competitors. And I shared information with them because we were competitors   * on the surface.   * But in really strategic thinking about that focus along that journey we eventually would have bubbled up eventually, I would have built a life 3, 60 app.   * And in doing and having these conversations that company started to realize we shared that same focus. And so it allowed me to get bubbled up on their radar. It also learned, allowed me to learn a whole bunch from competitors for potential competitors without having to come across looking like I was a threat.   * So this idea of focus, concentration, talent and expertise here.   * this isn't just like building people that are domain experts. What I want you to think about is building a team of the right people.   * Let me give you some examples.   * there's how many people, when I say, like a firefighter on your team.   * What do you think of when I say, like, someone's a firefighter without all the immediate issues?   * What's like sometimes   * a firefighter. What are some of the things that like if you think of like some of the challenges with those people?   * What are some of the challenges that people are as firefighters.   * Did you not understand systemic issues that can create the issue? In the 1st place.   * they got a lot of them.   * They   * tend to temporarily solve like issues like they don't get to the root of the issue. They just put out fires   * right? So they may be an incredible domain expert. But what happens if you build up your whole team firefighters.   * we gonna innovate much. It's gonna be a solutions. 1st approach.   * yeah, it's gonna be a solutions 1st approach nailed it exactly right?   * So it's not just important to hire people that are forward thinkers, domain expert. But it's hiring and building the right squad because you do need firefighters.   * They can't not exist. You are going to have fires, and you need people to fire, fight those fires.   * and when you are coming across a gnarly, even forward thinking problem. They're really great to help solve those problems. You need those people. This is not to say you don't need them. You just can't have a team of only firefighters.   * So when we're talking about talent and expertise.   * I'm not just talking about domain expertise. That's certainly it shared domain expertise. Think about what lior said, how important it is to understand the truckers, the industry. If you're going to innovate in that understanding, the pain those customers are having, but equally as important as when you hire, and you structure your team, make sure you don't have just a whole bunch of problem solvers and not a lot of problem prevention.   * Now, when you also think of like product managers, or innovators.   * there's another type of person, too. There's like the dreamer.   * You probably have come across these. They're like, have all the great ideas.   * but they have real hard time breaking that down into like structured execution.   * and then flip side. You got a lot of people that are really good at executing and optimizing, but they struggle with like really thinking about what's next they want to. It's not a desire, it's just   * they haven't yet built that muscle, or whatever it may be, and you may not be able to build that muscle instantaneous, of course. And so as you build up. And as you structure these teams, if you think about phase separation, if you think about having some people focus over here. Just keep in mind that this also needs to be a talent management exercise.   * You need to go through, write down everyone on your team and start literally putting them into buckets.   * If you haven't used tools like index, it's a way to bring a little bit more objectivity to this. So instead of you just assessing them like this, it's helpful to have an independent resource. Do this for you, but there are a number of   * tools out there like this, like the Colby Index, and others that will help with a battery of questions. Get you to categorize your team. Not only does this help you as a leader, identify opportunities for them. But it ensures that as you build your team structures, you don't accidentally put a team of all firefighters or all Futurists, or all just optimizers like you're trying to build a balanced team.   * And then you're trying to also make sure that that team understands within that structure, that where they sit in that, because what will also happen is conflict.   * If you put a team of like the visionaries and the firefighters, they will get into fights   * because the firefighters think all the stuff they're doing is bullshit.   * and the visionary person will think all the firefighter team is doing is bullshit, and so when they come upon a problem, they will get into like this bites. It's like, almost.   * And you probably have seen some of this happen.   * And the reason for this   * is, they don't know that they're a firefighter or a visionary, or they don't know the other person, and then they have to understand that that person is there on their team   * help as a complementary skill to them.   * They need to think of that as my left arm to my right, the r. 1 unit. I know you're that way, you know. I'm this way.   * We need to act this way, because that is how we harness our strengths together and ship.   * but not knowing it, creates the time.   * If you acknowledge that, and you put it out there before they embrace it.   * and they know their role and how they fit into it.   * And it removes that conflict, knowing that's how they act.   * And that's how they're deploying, also gives them a way to think about development opportunity   * in a way that's not judgment.   * It's acknowledging that, taking that strength and making sure it fits in the team.   * Okay?   * So if I think, then, about the kind of matrix of problem solving and problem retention. What is important as you recruit your team, whether it's in your interview questions, whether it's in the job. Rec itself. Understand? In this role, am I trying to hire a problem solver?   * Hi, baby?   * Or I'm trying to hire a problem, and how I ask questions in the interview.   * Help me understand what are   * and the role in which I need, I should ask myself, do I need one of these over the other. Now, of course, if I can get both   * great, but the trap is you identified? Only a problem solver? Not.   * That's the trend.   * If you typically the problem. Renters oftentimes I have found are pretty good problem solvers, too. That's why I would put them like this kind of problem creators category in the top right?   * But certainly the folks in the   * quadrant like can be problematic, if not understood how to manage that talent   * and how to put them into the right.   * The also difficulty is a lot of times, the firefighters on the left. It's because of the role they've been.   * This is the whole like. Oh, we brought in this innovation team to do this. I could do this.   * It's like, well, yes, you could. But like I need you focus here, then give them the flex and the time to maybe the next year over like give them a role more on the problem prevention side. Not necessarily always because that's how they are. It could also be. It's the role they've been.   * It's important for you to know whether it's the goal or whether it's actually the aptitude.   * If it's the role he's solving.   * if it's the aptitude a little bit more difficult.   * Okay.   * we'll also be talking about tools and behaviors through the course. So lots of different frameworks and tools to use, one of them being like the Pr. FAQ. Tool that Amazon uses to sit and think really thoughtfully about the end. At the beginning. I think there's there's different versions of this that different companies have.   * We're gonna bring in a the Vp of design for aws to talk to us about the Pr process at Amazon, so you can get a insider's view of how that process works to inspire what you all do with your teams and with yourself.   * But we'll be using this throughout. All of these aren't to say like this isn't just the only lecture to talk about. These are the enablers that we will be talking about through the next 5 weeks. We'll constantly be reinforcing this, and we will be setting up our modules or lectures to go deeper on all of these topics. So we will constantly be giving you tools culture examples.   * Okay, this gets us to the 10 types of innovations. I'm gonna go through this quickly, because hopefully, you guys all did the reading but what I want to really reinforce here is like the right side and the left side of the house, and like thinking through like   * these, are like your S type of strategy type innovations. These are your type of strategy innovations. This is like your core tech stuff. This is like the self driving tech that we were talked about.   * And then, but really, what you heard about was like   * that wasn't why his his business is successful.   * Maybe it was how it started.   * It certainly is still an element.   * but it's not why his business is successful. His business is driven because of these other aspect.   * And so, as you approach your capstone, every time people focus here your homework over the next and needs   * is to start thinking and challenging yourself about these other signs.   * One of the examples that I think is really interesting is also this concept of open innovation   * of like ideas don't all come from just inside the organization. So lior talked about acquiring right like having a process to make sure that's not always invented here. Sometimes companies can get in the trap of like not invented here, mentality   * of understanding where your core competencies are, where you can get inspiration from outside. So in the case of lior, they realized they had to acquire a new business to help them unlock a different type of innovation. But there's ways in which you can   * kind of open source or crowdsource innovation. So one of these was to understand network dynamics of kind of essentially social media, how people were influencers, and how they got to connect to people.   * And the way that they did this is, they went ahead, Darpa. We talked about Darpa. They released 10 balloons across the United States and gave out a huge cash prize, for who could buy? But they didn't tell anyone where they were   * anywhere in the entire Us. And so teams quickly put together ways to crowdsource and identify people. And what that did was it   * crowdsourced a way to figure out how people connect and how social media connectors work, and who those connector points are. And so this gave them a great insight into network technologies and network dynamics by using this process. So think of ways also of how you can outsource some of this innovation to your users or the community.   * I wanna get to our exercise really quick.   * I don't know if this was in the book, but it's in here for reference.   * Oftentimes, like when you look at the 10 types of innovation you're like, I get it in concept of, like, what are the different types of things sort of underneath them.   * And so underneath all of these, I've listed for you different types of innovations, like crowdsourcing open innovation, outsourcing decentralized management, licensing bundle, pricing like just to start getting you to think through how you can integrate some of these into your capstone.   * Because it's sometimes just too nebulous to think about those high level terms. This is really helpful for you to understand, like more executive sales.   * This will be in the in the slide. So don't worry about like writing this down   * so Golden Circle we've been alluding to this. It is a really simple   * is that, like most of you and your teams and most people understand the what and the how of the teams in the business.   * I think almost all the time, but oftentimes it's the why   * that is either eluding them or helps them reframe like.   * because when you ask what your company does like, they'll typically go here.   * They'll many times not go here. And so for your capstone, where, where you're with your teams. I want you to get together, and where you're leading right now.   * You may not have exactly the how and what yet, but you're probably slowly honing in on that.   * But what I wanted you guys to challenge yourself with, you know, 1015 min that we have is.   * ask yourself the why? Why do you exist? What's your purpose?   * Not the what and the how   * get to the why? Again, in in Geobit, like, I started with the what and how, and as soon as I started   * answering the why.   * not only did it unlock my roadmap, but it unlocked like recruiting, like being able to tell a bigger story, help so many other things. So get in your teams now, and we'll come together in 10 min.   * and we'll quickly discuss and share out.   * Try to get to the point.   * Okay.   * but not too much.   * Yes, for sure.   * No way.   * He was the 1st guy.   * Yeah, it's a really anchor to like kickstarting somebody into their   * continuing conversation. We'll do, maybe a couple of teams that we can share out.   * It's kind of empowering people in the kitchen as their life changes.   * That's kind of our yeah, our model.   * And then going back to how   * it's kind of into we helping them to integrate you to changes that are happening. For example, the smart devices that they installed.   * Well, what's important with this is that like, it's important to get all aligned on the why? Because the how can change? And it also is a way to de escalate conflict within teams. If you can get everyone to fall in love with the problem. The solutions become valuable and, like you can argue and bicker about them, and no one like takes it super personally, because you're all aligned on like, yes, we're all lined up all very passionate about solving this   * and the how we'll get there like we'll take ideas from everybody. So I'm I'm like.   * that's great. That's how. But like, that might change. And that's okay, like, just make sure that you guys get really crisp, really focused in on.   * So we're kind of also in the kitchen space. With all our work.   * we're kind of in a different way. Our what is that? We want to make the cooking experience more enjoyable for families. The how is by reducing the cognitive load during the cooking process? And the why is because everyone deserves a nutritious meal on their   * yeah. So our why is really centered around helping students land their 1st internship, which is a tool to career pathing. And so the why is really centered around getting students ready for whatever that 1st internship looks like. The how is around additional portfolio? I think there's more work to be done in. How?   * Why say that one more time? Why is helping students land their 1st internship? Okay. So I want you to   * do like you heard of the 5 wise?   * You have 5 wise on that.   * and and get real irritating with yourself and your partners on asking 5 more. Because I think there's a bigger why behind there   * that you guys can kind of.   * I expanded a little bit more. So it's to help us to navigate the challenges when   * apply for their 1st initial experiences, collect internships, volunteer roles and 1st jobs   * like, yeah, it's it's meant to be a bit funny. But like.   * Do them jab each other on why and why and why? Because, like, you will get to uncover like a bigger, I think emotional like story. There, that might unlock some other things. I'll give you an example of this. So there's a guy named Bob. He worked with Clayton Christiansen.   * Anyone know Clayton Christensen hopefully. You do, because, he said one of the books wrote for you guys, there we go. So Bob Mesta worked with Clayton Christensen, and he really is is part of like the the guy that helped build out the jobs to be done framework   * right. And so, Bob, I've had the pleasure of meeting and working with Bob a few times, and he tells the story of, like the jobs to be done about like this idea of not customer interviews and customer discovery. But he calls it customer interrogation.   * and he's like, if you do it right.   * actually get the customer start getting busy.   * And he's like, then, you know, you're actually hitting in on the real me. He's like, because people like will tell you sort of what you think they should say or what they want to say. But like, when you really start asking these wise and interrogating. You get to find some much more insightful insights that they aren't willing to necessarily off the gate. Start to tell you.   * and let me give an example of how I use this. So in geobit we did this technique. And when we were asking people about why they found our product helpful.   * They were like, oh, because you know, like I don't have to, you know. Use this leash with my kid, and probably well, why would you lose? Well, because they might run away, and you just kept asking them why? The why, the why, why, and like what we really uncovered. Was that what Geobit did was allowed them to get sun.   * because they found themselves not leaving the house   * because they were afraid of the social stigma of shit.   * And so when we started talking about this like idea that it gets you out of the house, it gets some sunlight like, aren't you afraid like? And people. You're talking, my lady. Yeah, I'm stuck in my house all the time with my kid. I never get to get outside. I'd love to like, just get outside and get some fresh air and some sunlight. And like, I started realizing that these people were having vitamin d deficiency.   * And so it's like on the surface it was something. But actually, when we started interrogating them more now that really didn't really influence our product features. But it influenced how we talk to them.   * and the words in which we use to acquire the customer, because then we start talking their language. We're talking hyperbole, and like some like jargon.   * We were talking the words they were actually thinking, but when we're either too embarrassed to tell him.   * or we're like an inner mile, right? And it's like holy cow. This company unlocked my inner mile like that's what you're trying to do.   * You gotta move on to another team. Sorry.   * So our why is to prevent mistakes caused by misinformation and provide for calculators with peace of mind.   * Try to make that more concise.   * So like we try to prevent the mistakes happening   * to actually provide them peace of mind   * to be more confident in handling confidence. Yeah, confidence.   * Otherwise, for save money save money. Yeah, good. That's a good one. I love that one to simplify cooking meat. Prep   * to kitchen. Yeah, you guys are, gonna get adults. Yeah, to reduce food waste   * to take care of. I mean, it's about mental health and physical health and promote sustainability.   * All right. So good. We're a couple of minutes over. Thank you for all sharing. This is a you're gonna constantly do this. This isn't like one and done. You're gonna continue to be asking yourself these questions. Don't be afraid. Give yourself permission to be annoying with your team members right off the bat. Acknowledge it. You're gonna get really annoying with each other and challenge each other with the why and think about that customer interrogation method of the 5 whys   * to really get to some deep rooted insights, particularly as you guys move into customer discovery and like coming out of Joellen's class and Lisa's class. And as we move into our capstone class in a few more weeks like you'll do another round of research, or if you have some time to do some work like practice, some of that they'll be super helpful, I guarantee.   * Alright. So the assignment for next week is in your is in the syllabus for all of you guys. The slides for today are already on canvas so you can download them immediately. As soon as I get home I will send out, and I'll upload to canvas the Transcript, which you can then import directly into your notebook. Lm, instance and I will send out the notes from today as well summarized from my agent.   * If you have any more thoughts on some things you want to see from the next 5 weeks. Please send me a note. I will also have office hours weekly, so if you'd like to join those you're free. I will send out what those are. They'll typically be in the evening time.   * I don't do just like direct one on ones. Otherwise my whole week, I think, would be filled up with them. So just join, and oftentimes, if you have a question, your other students will probably benefit from hearing that question, too. So know that you may have an audience, and I'll try to have about an hour and a half of office hours each week. Put aside in the evening again. I will send those out. I will try to make them consistent.   * I'll pick a time where they're at the same time every single.   * Okay. Alright guys, great to see you all. And hopefully, we inspired a few things for you. And we'll talk to you guys next week. ",

              "value": "=* **John Renaldi**  \n* Yeah.  \n* what happened in the world of product and innovation this week? That jumped out to you in the news.  \n* anything?  \n* Anyone follow the news from Openai this week.  \n* No, come on, somebody.  \n* What did they open? AI release this week?  \n* Agents for everybody. So instead of being able to know how to build your own. You can go inside. They call it asks.  \n* So you can just write in human language something that you want Openai to go do for you on behalf, and it'll autonomously go off and start doing that for you. So taking away some of the technical complexity from being a developer or having some sort of technical chops, and just being able to be a normal  \n* person and writing in normal English to it, to execute on some type of autonomous task that you wanted to run, whether it's every day based on some type of trigger that will only, of course, evolve over time. It's powerful enough for probably sort of the 70 to 80% of people that are consumers. Of course, it's not necessarily geared towards builders. It's geared towards consumers.  \n* So check it out. That was the latest news from Openai this week.  \n* so in terms of what we're going to go through today, a little bit of a recap from where we left things last week, just to hammer home a few key points.  \n* And then we're gonna have a discussion really focused on human centric innovation. And particularly around how we think about getting closer to the user organizations that are closer to the user. And we'll have a couple of quick discussions around that, too. We'll have an exercise. We'll spend some time through a framework called the Jobs Framework. Anyone ever hear of the jobs to be done framework before. Yeah, let's see. Show of hands  \n* amazing. We had to do it. Read the book, the whole thing  \n* great. So we're going to go a little bit further with it, so this will probably will fly through some of that, and we'll spend then a little bit more time on the exercise around the jobs framework. Because I want you guys to start applying that framework to your capstone. So I want you guys to get in some groups and we'll spend some time around the jobs framework today. And so we also have a guest speaker Kieran, from Airbnb will be with us. Kieran is a product leader there. He's also a alumni of the program.  \n* So he's going to talk to us a little bit about innovation through the lens of how things are done at Airbnb, a little bit different of a company. What do we know about Airbnb? What's sort of unique about them as a structure?  \n* Anyone know, this is stuff  \n* like a two-sided marketplace. It's a two-sided marketplace. Yeah. So you've got hosts and you've got guests. The structure of the actual business.  \n* Brian Chesky is the founder very founder driven company. So it can have potential for that. Moses trap that idea of having one person that anoints innovation and says, this is the thing we should be focused on. It has a flip side. It can bring amazing focus. It also means that if Brian gets hit by a bus  \n* screwed right? Now we'll talk to Karen a little bit about how innovation is managed, Airbnb, even though Brian's responsible for the vision and setting the why.  \n* And he does a really great job of that. He does split up his organization to focus on that next level. So he'll prompt with, here's the why I need you to go ahead and figure out what's next? What are we doing in the next 6 months? What are we doing in the next 12 months? What are doing in the next 3 years, and he puts some teams and budgets to those bets to go off and explore.  \n* He also puts innovation, then down into his franchise business lines, too. So within there they all have dedicated capacity to be focusing in on what's next. And then he has a separate team, also similar to Google. They have research arms, and then they have dedicated capacity within each GM to focus on what's next.  \n* and also similar a bit to Uber, where lior mentioned in Uber freight, how he put some of that inside of all of the teams. So a little bit of a hybrid type of organizational structure that Airbnb has. And we'll talk to Kieran a little bit about that.  \n* Okay, let's get on with where we left things off last week. As we kind of reflect back and think about last week. What were some of the things that stuck out to you, and maybe particularly from the conversation with lior. What is sort of the key points that we really hammered home last week.  \n* Hold on intrin like monopoly in from this kind of contra intuitive right? Yep.  \n* it's really funny to read about how he kind of  \n* criticizes the American educational system. Okay, that's what I see with my European perspective, that someone from within the culture is the same.  \n* Yeah, the idea of monopoly, a little bit of a maybe a contrarian type of view of that. But it's really around dominating within a smaller market, finding your beachhead and going beyond going really deep instead of wide. That's right. That's right. Bringing that that idea of focus.  \n* I was. Gonna say, like they can't work for me.  \n* Yep, that's right. And and that wise story gives him a much cleaner. Now, roadmap versus being overly focused on a on a technology. Right? So he he let himself fall into the trap of being technology led, which  \n* I think a lot of entrepreneurs and companies do.  \n* And you can see from that example with lior potentially the trap there, and how he quickly course corrected to be more holistic and more, I would say, focused on the user and by bringing it back to the user he was then able to bring more balance in terms of having a user focus substantiated with a business strategy and the technology itself. All 3 of those things, I think, in his examples, really come together nicely and start to balance each other out, but with a focus back on the user.  \n* just to add on like the pillars of innovation. Yeah, I think just the  \n* how he thought about referring like just thinking about the I, the idea, and the why behind it. It shifted. It was he was more empathetic. It was more focused on the user and it transformed from. Or we're not a self driving company. We're a logistics company.  \n* And so that shift just reinforces how totally totally. And that same shift happened to me and my experience with my company. We started off also, if you remember me telling that story with a very technology centric lens, we were focused primarily on location based systems and the technology around that building really low power algorithms  \n* and that took us into a into a into sort of an area that we just were. We didn't really figure out what was our mission, or what was the why it was about out innovating somebody else with just the tech  \n* when we started to pivot to that, why, we started to think more strategically about the market, about our competitors, about our potential acquisition targets around our user. And it gave us a really really clear roadmap versus the location-based system is always just like, what's the next tact? What's the next little thing that we can do slightly better than the next person. What's the next little incremental little thing we can differentiate on  \n* to be just that much better than the next guy versus being something that focused primarily on the why and building up that reputation with your customer base as deeply caring about their needs through their lens, using their language and using frameworks like the jobs framework to do that  \n* any any other. Yeah, go ahead.  \n* I the flywheel effect. Yep.  \n* yeah.  \n* Yeah. And and remember me reinforcing last week to just really, I'd like you guys for your capstones as you start to build that out. Think through what is that flywheel for your business, and think through those S type innovations from the 10 types of  \n* innovations from Keeley's book we kind of segmented those into the configuration, the experience, the product system on the ends. You have more S-type innovations in the middle. You have more P-type innovations. We will fall into a trap to focus on that. P. Make sure we're thinking more about those S-type innovations. And what is your flywheel look like? Inspired by those  \n* any other things from last week that jump out. Yeah, John, I thought it was a really interesting conversation about like team structure, and how you balance innovation. Yeah, team structure and firefighters and like preventors. Yep, I work in consulting. So it's very like, okay, here's a problem. Go fix it right now. Yeah.  \n* I hear some laughs it must resonate with some people. Yeah, totally. Does anyone have a really good story to share from their own company? In addition to what John was mentioning how he's seen that other things that you can share with your classmates about team structure and different types of people go ahead. Yeah.  \n* So my work has a technical support in here.  \n* And one of the structural issues that they got after a merger was to kind of shift from  \n* product based support to customer based support. Meaning that like at first, st teams were assigned. Then, like, you know, if a problem from this area of the application comes, this team solves it. Yeah. And when they move from product based support to customer base support, it means and that, like, you know, if  \n* Customer X reports an issue. This team resolves it, regardless of like what part of the application it goes into, what that kind of that structural change brought. It was like. Not everyone in the team was experts in like different areas of them, and that kind of brought like a lot of  \n* burden on some teams and some like the teams that were distributed weren't  \n* as efficient. So like in theory, it made more sense, like, you know, yeah, let's move from for management to kind of let's move from like product based to kind of have like 1 point of contact, so that customers feel safe enough that their case is not being tossed around.  \n* but like it was kind of it needed more of a hybrid matrix sort of thinking. Yeah. So I do think in that structure. Consulting companies do it fairly well where you've got sort of a focus on a project or a client. But then they layer in sort of service lines or domain expertise lines. Right? And you have sort of a hybrid reporting structure.  \n* Sure. So at Google, we created and and what you'll find in larger companies, especially companies like in big Tech is many different teams. There's no one size fits all way to manage your team or structure your team. They give quite a bit of latitude to different leaders in my organization. We had a problem in that. Our team was structured by technology.  \n* And so you had an OS team. You had a frameworks team. You had a Ui frameworks team and the structure was by technology product managers, engineers, designers were focused in on a tech stack.  \n* And the problem with that is is coming through that lens of being overly solving problems just through a technology versus the user. And so we changed that structure up. Now, what we ended up doing is when we were thinking through this problem similar to what you're talking about was that the reporting structures versus the focus structures.  \n* And so what we ended up doing is keeping the reporting structures the same into the technology, because that's where the domain. Expertise and competency came from, and they should be evaluated. A fair amount on that. And so if you're going to be an engineer that deeply cares about low, level OS framework.  \n* You probably want to report into somebody else that has a similar type of expertise for your career. But then we ended up putting them into what we would call squads that were focused on user problems. And so they would have a product lead for each of these areas that they would.  \n* you know, for all intents and purposes, take direction from on a day-to-day basis, as it relates to the backlog of work and overall focus on the problems they were solving were focused on customer. But they kept the reporting structure there. So that was one way in which we tried to solve this matrix problem and consulting companies do things very similarly right. They go into a project site. They may  \n* temporarily report into a particular partner or a senior manager, but then they have their service line that they go back to when the project is done.  \n* I mean just to add to that, in our opinion.  \n* at Google. What I liked about was  \n* thinking about where you had customers. There are 2 layers. So you had your sellers being your customers, and then by extension their clients. You, you did have a dedicated product team. But you also have this intermediary.  \n* which was essentially like a product marketing manager that was representing the voice of the customer and the voice of sales, and then being able to influence how the products are being built, and that that delineation was was very impactful, because when the product teams are focusing on how to get the engineers  \n* rally into one person building the product. But then having somebody else focusing on. Okay, what? What are the pain points? And how can we be more empathetic? And think about the you at the end user? Right?  \n* Some. It's very similar to the  \n* like Google, like in postman. When I joined there were siloed teams like marketing sales tech product.  \n* and the analogy which was given is like product team is creating a shelf where they are just bringing features and putting it in a shelf  \n* and marketing and sales are taking those features from the shelf and then taking it to the user. So there is a huge gap, and the product was getting very cluttered like too many features were getting built on. And then we introduced like a Pmm team, which is like an overlooked function for end to end, like how the features are getting developed, and  \n* we try to think about how the go to market function will operate even before love it. I mean, this is, you'll hear this from Kieran today. This exact point, Sam, of the way they've structured their product teams is they've reported them into the Cmo.  \n* So their product teams, if you may have heard Brian, the CEO made some waves. Maybe a year ago, he said. Product management is like not a thing for our company. We have product marketing, but we don't need product people to tell the engineers really like how to do their jobs like they can figure that out. And so they recruit more product minded engineering teams  \n* and more marketing customer user focused design focused product marketing people that. And and I think his critique  \n* is more on some of the I would say some of the the big tech company. Pm's get to be like, very, very, very technical into the weeds. I think his critique is more on that.  \n* It's more like, Hey, listen. I think you guys need to be focused more on the user problems and how to take this to market and be thinking about that from the day we start the product versus, like the infinite details of instrumentation of the product. Let that be the engineer's team to figure out. And so you'll hear about that today, where? And it's forced them organizationally  \n* to focus on the customer user problems upfront in the process so very similar, we talked about, and we're going to hear next week from Amazon. But this idea of a Pr. FAQ, a press release at the onset of developing a product before you even pitch what the product is. You are developing the press release and talking about it through the eyes of a user or a customer, and talking about the go to market  \n* all the way up front, the way they've solved this organizationally. They've just put that into the marketing function, and Kieran will talk about that today where, when they kick off product features, they're talking about how they bring it to market from day one, so that everyone is connected on the why and the people within the actual Marcom group. The people that are communicating the features are having a hand in the conversations upfront.  \n* Yes, Josh, we've had trouble implementing this consistently, but I think the coolest way to do this is definitely  \n* launch the landing page, get it out there. Yes.  \n* before you start building. And like we've only mentioned like 5 times. But every time it's been like  \n* 100% agree with you, Josh, it's a really really great way to start just from day one thinking about the user and then collecting like getting everyone familiar with collecting information from customers and using that to guide you. So that you can have some checkpoints in with users  \n* almost as before you've started building it. I did something very similar to that, Josh. When I started my company. We didn't have a product yet, and we knew it was going to take us quite some time. It was a hardware product, and we were having a challenge in that venture. Capital companies, even at that time, didn't want to necessarily fund hardware businesses. They felt that they were capital in.  \n* They take a really long time to get to market. Some of these are, in fact, true, and so we needed to show to them some type of traction, some type of custard demand some type of ability that we could prove. We could collect information from customers, and we could potentially sell our product early and so to inform that we did exactly this. We launched a landing page. We launched ads, and we used that to inform our product.  \n* We would actually just look through the comments of ads again. Our product didn't even exist yet. We were just talking more about the problem we were out solving, and then, like teasing a little bit of the product. But the comment section  \n* and the information from the landing page as we're collecting emails from people was invaluable to really have some really early, fairly cheap customer insights, and the people that would go as far as to comment on an ad of a company that doesn't really exist yet are going to continue talking to you. So it was really easy for us to DM them, and it was free customer insights.  \n* free customer discovery. We didn't have to give them $50 Amazon gift cards or anything. So as you think about your businesses and your product, this is an amazing way to collect early information from your customers upfront and early.  \n* So in terms of sort of my takeaways from some of last week, I'll start with that story that I told around innovation through the lens of the early days of what became Darpa, the ability to focus in on a really strong pain point. And some of this really to speak to some of the questions that came last week  \n* come to change management, and making sure the organization feels that pain, because, without feeling that pain. Oftentimes it's very difficult to get the organization  \n* to move. So you certainly don't want to create a false sense of a crisis. But you should be able to articulate that very well. Why, this is a pain for the organization and make it a crisis  \n* that will start to move. You think, through what really moved innovation in World War Ii. With the United Kingdom. They were right. Next to Germany. The United States was over here, hanging out. They just didn't feel that pain. And I just want you to think about that. It's a very similar metaphor to organizations. If they don't feel the pain, they're less incentivized to move  \n* and also think through the role of champions and leaders, a general manager structure, something that can bring together all the pieces of the organization. If you're in a siloed or matrix organization, think about how you build that champion or the importance of having that champion to help you move  \n* things through. It wasn't at Motorola until we had that champion where we were able to take a project. Finally ship it. We had similar types of product ideas  \n* 3 different times before going back all the way back to the original razor idea. So when razor was initially the old, old razor, like the flip phone, 2,003 razor. So I was on a team at Motorola at that time, and the original razor was meant to be a product that could be completely customizable.  \n* So it eventually came in different colors, like pink and black and other things. But the original idea was to launch the product  \n* with the ability for customers to completely customize that product, and we did it again a second time about 5 years later, so kept on having these nos nos nos, and really, yes, there were some other reasons, but some of the biggest reasons why none of those projects really succeeded. We didn't really properly have a champion that represented the whole entity of the business, the power of 10 x innovations.  \n* Peter Thiel also talks about this in his book about having some sort. It's not enough to just have a 20% improvement on something. Now, this doesn't have to be technology. So oftentimes it's spoken about through the lens of technology, which is Ok. But some type of metric, some type of user metrics, some type of outcome that you have 10 x  \n* 5 x, whatever it may be. But as you think about your capstone or your business. If you're thinking about innovation that next leap. I'm not talking about the next roadmap thing 6 months from now. But I'm talking about that next leap, that next unlock for your business.  \n* What is that outcome that you're going to? 2, 3, 4, 5, 10 x, not just 20%. So I thought that that was really nicely communicated through the example that we talked about the World War 2, 1,  \n* and then also really, really reinforcing. Yet again, do not focus only on product or P based innovations. Really, really think about all of those S based innovations. We spoke enough about lior and uber freight, the flywheel, some of his thinking about why.  \n* And also when we talked about the 6 pillars of innovation, we recaptured some of those things that stood out to you. But culture, the focus on talent, making sure that you're building a team that accurately reflects all of the various different types of personality traits. The way people work.  \n* Colby Index is a way you can think of many others. I know you guys all took a test to. I think earlier on, is that right?  \n* Didn't you guys take some sort of like, it wasn't a personality test, but like some type of  \n* strengthsfinder. Yeah.  \n* yeah. So you did something like that already that gave you, and it doesn't have like there's a lot out there right. There's no set way. I'd implore you all as you become product leaders and people leaders to find the one that works for you. But the point being is, find one  \n* and understand that you need to think about that as you build your team and do a talent assessment in order to optimize your organization for innovation. Because if you don't do that talent assessment. You do run that risk of overloading your team with one or the other types of people, and you need that balance in the organization.  \n* Let's see here a couple of things that I wanted to highlight from the book. We didn't get a chance to go super deep into any of these last week. We sort of skipped through them, but I wanted to take a moment and sort of reinforce them, because I think, as you build your pitches, and as you build into  \n* next quarter, as you move into finishing up your capstone, I think many of these will be very important for how you communicate your ultimate business and product for your capstone presentation that happens in June. The 1st one is going to be  \n* what you know. Certainly we hope that we're going to hear a whole lot of why user centricity. But within that we do really want to see and hear what technological innovation is there as well. What is that engineering breakthrough, or what is that secret that you've uncovered that you've been able to apply a technology to? That's novel. So we do want to hear some type of technology that you've thought through, or a way to use it in a novel way.  \n* The second is probably just as important is why, now.  \n* if you read any of like the Vc. Blogs, you'll hear this often spoken about of this idea of timing.  \n* Why is this problem? And the reason why is many times the problems you will talk about are problems they've heard before, or other people have heard, or your management has heard, or your boss has heard these problems have maybe existed in an organization for some time. And so this just isn't about pitching this for capstone. It's about pitching it within your business today.  \n* So when you go and you pitch a new innovation or a new product to your boss.  \n* the question is not just the why, of course, the question is not just what it is, nor how it works. But the why. Now, why is this important to the user? Now.  \n* why is this important to the organization now the business?  \n* And why is it potentially able to happen now from a technological perspective? What innovation maybe, has happened that we've picked up on. Maybe the cost of AI is so cheap it allows us to execute and do this. Now, maybe it's because some other cost has lowered. That allows us to scale that. Just wasn't there  \n* 3, 4, 5 years earlier. So why, now is super important that I want to reinforce from his book.  \n* We talked a little bit about the monopoly. The idea of a monopoly is a bit different, I think, than probably what most people think about, and the ability to kind of find that 1st entry point a market that's big enough. It maybe doesn't look like it's the hugest market. And that trap that I think many product people and entrepreneurs make when they build out a business case  \n* is they'll go with. If we only could get 1% of this big market.  \n* We'll be millionaires. Or this product will be amazing. This kind of 1% of a big market just doesn't give you the focus. And so the the point here is.  \n* I think, even with your own capstones we really want to be able to see that focus. You've heard this now many different times through different lenses. But that focus to dominate within a particular beachhead.  \n* Find that small enough market where you're not, 1% of you are near 100% of that 1 1st entry point. And maybe that thing isn't the 1 billion dollar business.  \n* But you show how you build upon it. And you build a platform, you build something that allows you to use that as an entry point and then build on. Think about the jobs framework and the why to help craft. Then what is the next market that we parlay into? And so think about how you become that monopoly within that beachhead.  \n* We've spoken about people. He brings this up as well reinforces. Why, it's part of our 6 pillars of innovation. We talked about structuring the teams. Distribution going to be, of course, super important with your capstones. And we talked about it also in the 10 types of innovations. But what is it, maybe, about the distribution, the way in which you bring your product to market. That might be innovative or different. Of course we can think back to the early days of e-commerce when  \n* everyone just thought of. Well, I could just be this. But online. But now it's, you know, that's just expected. What? What different thing about your distribution might allow yourself to differentiate and compete in a new way.  \n* And then the last point is the secret. Let me go back really quick.  \n* I think this is this really goes into Joellen and Elisa's class of like. What did you learn through your customer discovery  \n* that no one else has picked up on?  \n* What is that secret? What is that thing that you've keyed in on that you think others have glossed over  \n* and things like customer interrogation methods? Remember how I mentioned that of thinking through customer interviews, not as an interview, but as like an interrogation of a criminal  \n* and using the 5 whys, maybe make them a little uncomfortable. By the way you should do this with yourselves, too, like I mentioned. But through that process  \n* you will likely uncover that secret  \n* that other people aren't finding out, because they stopped with the 1st or second. Why? And you persisted, and you found that secret. So that's really a great thing to think about as you do your customer discovery.  \n* You should be trying to figure out for every person you interview what's their secret, and everyone may have slightly different variants. But you'll start to pattern match, and you'll start to find the commonality across all of them that all of their secrets start to sound a little similar, and as you find one, then you may be able to actually validate it with others.  \n* Think back to the story I told last week of one of my businesses around the mom, who never left her home.  \n* She was afraid of leaving because of judgment of this leash. Her child had severe autism, and so, if she would just to go out in public into a mall. This child would be a bolter. They would just run. But she this wasn't like her being a helicopter parent. This was a must thing. This child actually had to be on a leash. It sounds crazy.  \n* Sounds crazy that parents would have to use leashes, but when you hear this person talk about it, you're like, Oh, I get it. Why, you would need something like that, or think you need something like that, but because of her fear of social stigma around that she just didn't go anywhere. And so our product ended up helping her just get out of the house like that ended up being our secret  \n* thing that we found out by drilling, drilling, drilling, drilling, drilling. I'm like truly trying to find out the whys. That was our secret that we found out, and we found out others as well.  \n* Okay,  \n* So as we move into this week, I've alluded to this already in our discussion. But the focus is going to be around. How do we think more through that lens of putting the user first? st So you've got these 3 sort of this nice Venn diagram of trying to find balance between the user.  \n* the business  \n* and technology. And oftentimes we see businesses fail. I think often because they take one of these and prioritize them over the others.  \n* And I would say that those companies typically are like business, or like they think internally. So they're working like in the business, not on the business. So they have this very internal view like this is a problem for the business, not a problem for our user. It's a problem for our business. So we're going to go ahead and solve this problem for ourselves.  \n* Or it's a technology focused thing. We're going to put forward lior. The idea of the self-driving trucks. First, st he didn't put the user first.st  \n* And so businesses often sort of create these self serving focuses that are, you know, many times monetarily focused. Of course, we're all companies need to make money. But when we think about how to maximize those revenues. It's oftentimes not with just a simple business prompt or a business problem. It's with focusing in on the user.  \n* And and I think now particularly relevant in today's age is. And and I would say.  \n* it's as an investor. I see this like all the time. It's the using AI for AI's sake. We are an AI powered blah blah blah\\! And the company never explains to you why that matters  \n* like, what new problem have you solved by making this AI powered? Or have you just gone ahead and increased your costs? Because every time you run your code it's running on a shit ton more compute than it should. So think through what problems you're solving. So oftentimes I advise founders to not even talk about AI in the front of their pitch.  \n* Talk about the problem. Talk about the user. And at the end you just subtly mention, we're using it as a tool. Because unless you're actually building a foundational model. Or you have some novel algorithms that make you truly an AI company. It's like going back in time and hearing every business say.  \n* we are a web company that sell like, yeah, I get it. You built. You have a website, and you have software that doesn't make you an Internet company. It just means that's a tool in which you've built your business around.  \n* So don't fall into that trap of just talking about the tech and and particularly relevant for companies. I think right now, as we think about AI, it's  \n* amazing how many AI companies they they say they are, but they are not  \n* Jonah. As an example. This reminded me of  \n* a big mistake my last company had made over and over which was  \n* saying, stuff that wasn't really AI was AI like  \n* like, basically like the software use reverse like reverse image search or like Ocr.  \n* and they were like, we're using AI to do. And I'm sure that  \n* we lost sales by doing that, because if they weren't  \n* sometimes they would say like, Wait, that's not AI, or they would think it and be like these guys are bullshit.  \n* And but in in the founders, mind, it was like, we need a, we need to say that we have to say, I, somehow.  \n* yeah, yeah, it's it's I would say, 9 times out of 10 when I drill into a company. And I hear this, it's that they've used a chat. They've used an open AI Api, or a Gemini Api, or anthropic Api to help with a workflow of something right that they've automated. And it's just a tool, and so, you know, don't fall into that trap. And I think also this idea of like  \n* this, this goes to the importance of the champion.  \n* But as we think about organizations, they inherently will, especially as teams grow and organizations grow, their silos silos are going to happen, and they affect that collaboration. So, thinking through, how might we, using some of the things we just mentioned? How might we  \n* change some things in our organization? How might we change some processes? How might we change some structures to start to bring about more of a hybrid focus on the user we talked about in Google and my team, we had these tech focus teams and we overlaid the customer problems into these. We didn't change the reporting structure. We created more virtual squads and teams. But  \n* how can we break that down in your organization and think about that? And as we think about these 3 pillars of business  \n* user technology, let's use some examples to talk about where things went wrong, and one of these  \n* was overpowering the others. And what results? Set it up.  \n* Anyone know what the this is?  \n* Fire phone fire phone. Yes, who remembers the Amazon fire phone? Not many.  \n* So reason for that. It flopped in spectacular fashion very quickly. And if you use the product, or you saw the reviews of it, you would know why  \n* Amazon, since Rishi brought it up. Rishi, what of those 3? Did Amazon prioritize above all else of the technology business and user.  \n* which is more of technology and business. They never thought about the user. That's right. And I of those, I'd argue the business because you open it up as just a big ad, basically, for all of Amazon's like trying to get you to buy shit. And no, no user just wanted that right. They they it's like, almost they never talked to anybody. I can't believe the Pr FAQ even got approved on this product.  \n* And so, despite your best intentions to be focused on the user and how you bring it to market, I think in this, Pr. FAQ, they probably over focused on how the go to market would work and less about the actual end user. But the fire phone was a spectacular disaster focused primarily on trying to solve a business problem and taking if some product manager pitch that product as a, this is the problem of the business, not this is the problem of our user.  \n* Jonah, what what would you think about it if a  \n* basically gave it for free like, there's a TV company that like, now that it's like we'll give it to you for free. But we'll have a bar beneath that has ads. So you know, I think in the case they've taken that model, of course, with subsidizing their kindle devices. So they they learned from this, you know they didn't just like shut their ears. They learned from this experience  \n* and did exactly that Jonah, but they realized that they could focus more on the E-reader market by that business approach or that model than this device.  \n* Okay, next one up.  \n* I was going to bring this up, I think a quintessential, relevant one. Now. So let's talk. Okay. Who knows? Besides, Rishi, who knows what this is some.  \n* It's like an AI PIN which you put in your body. Yeah, yeah. Humane. Built this product to quite some fanfare. And then.  \n* not so much fanfare. Let's break this down. What about this business? Let's talk about the user. Let's talk about the technology. And let's talk about the business angle of this. What did what did they prioritize? Maybe more to make this out of balance?  \n* Just yeah. Technology, very tech focused right? It feels a lot like lior's early business. Right? It's like, let's build self-driving trucks. Let's build this this AI thing that like they came from that lens of like we could build it. So we should, and if we don't, somebody else will, I can almost guarantee it was. If we don't do it, somebody else will, because they convinced themselves so much into that like  \n* that, that fantasy land that there will be this, like Jetson, communicator with everybody that they just focused in on that totally, I think, disregarding the user. What else about this product really stands out from what you know about it?  \n* Anything else?  \n* Research related.  \n* Yeah, they did it for purposely.  \n* but like they didn't, I guess, reach out to people to see if they want people wanted it.  \n* Yeah, yeah, I would say that they they definitely  \n* They had a bit of a tunnel vision, and if they did enough research, I think there would have been enough indicators sort of shying them away from it, or they only talked to customers in Palo Alto.  \n* which is also a problem when you do your research right, that's self reinforcing. Because if you want some research, like when you kick off research, it should not be through the lens of validating your hypotheses. It should be about trying to disprove your hypotheses and giving your researchers some space away from the product team. Because if you only make this about what you're doing like, you'll get the self reinforcing stuff.  \n* And like so many times I've had to talk to my teams about like the research that came back. And it was like overly puffy and like great about our products. And I'm like.  \n* that's bullshit. Let's break this down like, I want to know who you recruited, who need to talk to what are the questions and really get into the details of like, I want you to start your research saying poke holes in this, not tell me why this is great like that should be, how you go approach it, and I would be willing to bet they they were very  \n* narrow in the way in which they conducted their their research effectively.  \n* Moses, trap, yeah.  \n* yeah, I mean, listen. It's sort of the Steve jobs, you know, like the Steve Jobs way they had kind of emulate. They tried to emulate him. Some of them had worked at Apple, and even Steve got it wrong, right? Like we, we tend to ignore some of his flops.  \n* One is coming up shortly, so we'll talk about that. But it is a trap that's there.  \n* Eduardo. Yeah, I think, even though it's like it was a technical based company. I think the technical visibility wasn't there. Like, if you look at the Demos, the trader versus what?  \n* Yeah over promise under deliver. Right? Yeah.  \n* Okay, so with that, this is the next product. Anyone know what this is? The hint is it's related to Steve Jobs.  \n* Yeah, it's the next computer drew. What do you know? And what can you tell your classmates about the next computer? You know, when when C drugs got kicked out of apple. He went and founded his own company.  \n* That's kind of all I really know.  \n* and that's pretty much all you need to know about next, because it didn't go anywhere. It's the same one that he like bought as like a full front page. He basically gave all the technical specs about it. Bingo Bingo. Exactly right. So it was like his entire pitch was  \n* all tech. Even Steve learned to be the great communicator and marketer that he became by making these failures, and this was one of them all he talked about, even though he was a charismatic leader. All he talked about was the tech about how great and it was. It was truly an amazing tech.  \n* And OS your OS X. That runs all of your Macs, is this.  \n* this was the basis for all. Mac operating system.  \n* even to this day, is all built off of the next computer.  \n* so your Macs wouldn't be as powerful and performant as they were if it wasn't for this technology. But the product itself never went anywhere. Apple itself realized the innovation of the Low Level Tech  \n* and decided to acquire the company for that particular reason, but as a consumer and as a business standalone it was quite a failure. Now, going also to the far side of technology. We talked about this company last week. Park, who remembers what Park does or did  \n* at the time? What innovations did they come up with  \n* graphic interface, graphic interface mouse bunch of other stuff. So technology focused and user focused.  \n* they were really great at both of those realizing the problem with command prompts, hey, no one wants to type all this stuff. What if we could make it visual? What if, instead of a keyboard, we could have this like human interaction with something that was more intuitive. We'll call it a mouse like super user focused  \n* great super technology focused awesome.  \n* But they didn't care at all or think about the business aspect whatsoever. Which is why this is a failure. So we can. We can go to the other side of it. We can say we can focus on the business and tech and be a failure. We can also focus on the user  \n* and be a total failure.  \n* And this is a great example of that.  \n* Okay, so all of this is to say, having a more user centric  \n* thinking, user centric forward innovation process or innovation culture is certainly the way to start, but not the place to end. And we think about user centric. It's easy to say these things. But let's talk about breaking this down into specifics. What are the actual things you can do to be more user focused. So empathy and customer focused in your interviews.  \n* So interviewing through some of the things we've talked about right now, finding the secret.  \n* 5 Ys customer interrogation  \n* jobs framework, like all of these things, can be done design thinking around building that empathy and customer focus also in your values. If your company or your team doesn't have them like, build those Okrs, build those values to talk about getting people in front of those customers  \n* getting them to. We talked about some of those tips and tricks around role swaps, having engineers sit down and take customer service chats whatever that is for your organization. Think about how to build and instill that customer empathy and focus  \n* that balance of needs. An organization thinks about the technology. They think about the business as they put together their pitch, but it doesn't lead with it. Anytime. You're going to write a Prd or review one or hear a pitch from one of your team members if it starts with  \n* we are an AI powered blah blah, just like, stop right there, or we are going to change this text. Stop right there. Let's start with the user. The technologies to be supporting that should not be leading with that.  \n* avoiding those technology traps the next one  \n* so many times we all get busy and teams will tout. You know I did all of these things. I conducted all these interviews. I did all of these things, and it's great. You did all of these outputs. But what was the outcome?  \n* What thing are you actually trying to achieve and improve. We can say we do all of this stuff. But if we're not setting forth very clearly upfront, what is the outcome we want to achieve.  \n* Then we've set ourselves up for failure, too. And so when you write that product brief.  \n* think about those measurements upfront. What are we trying to what's our real outcome that we're trying to achieve? And how is this product? And how is how is the implementation of this product? How are we going to measure that to know if we've been successful with our efforts.  \n* understanding our customer segments.  \n* saying upfront, who the customer is. This sounds super basic, but so many times overlooked in any product pitch. It's who is this? For? I don't understand.  \n* or a business pitches me as an investor, I'm like, so who is this, you've never spoken to me who this is? For? You told me the problem. But it's so generic I can't understand who actually has this problem.  \n* Who is this? Be very focused on who your customer is, and understanding your segments, and maybe even more importantly, I have seen this done very well, is who it's not.  \n* This is not for this person, this segment, or this business, and why Rishi.  \n* so one. I'm curious to hear your thoughts about this. So  \n* there are companies who start up when they do this in their approach, but somehow they lose their  \n* they lose the philosophy or the Mojo. Yeah, it's like, okay, you know what? We're just how have companies or teams or leaders have reset back into a user? You know, I've seen most of the time just through some sort of abysmal failure.  \n* That's the that's the easiest one like we've gone down this path. Motorola did this. So they they had a lot of really great user insights. And then they had the razor. And they're like, let's just milk this thing for all it's worth.  \n* And let's take every innovation arm. And let's put them on building more razors. And so they shut down almost all of our advanced research. So one thing that  \n* most don't know is that the early formation of smartphones we think of, like many people think, oh, well, you know, Apple was the 1st of smartphone. There was lots of smartphones before there.  \n* and Moto was one of the 1st that had touchscreen smartphones, and in those devices it was run off of which was crazy at the time it was run off of Java and Linux, which was the basis for Android and the eventual later on, smartphones as well. This was already being done in 2,001,  \n* and when razor took off in 2,003, they needed more engineers to build more razors, and they shut all of it down. They took all of those engineers, and just said, Go build more razors. So to your point, I think oftentimes it's through something like this, where they maybe had the right structure, but some type of big like they got dollars in their eyes, and they just  \n* moved everybody over, or they're in trouble, and they think their way out of it is just to milk a cash cow business versus investing in what's next. And then that gravy train runs out right, because and this will happen in like PE firms, or, you know, if you work for a company that's owned by private equity. This is sort of their jam, like we're going to buy this business, and we're going to. Basically sorry. But like, suck it dry of all the cash. And we aren't going to really invest in a horizon. 3\\.  \n* It is just our cash cow, and that's part of our portfolio strategy. It's going to be our cash cow, and so, depending on how the business is formed if it's PE based. This could also be a reason why it wasn't before, and then it was bought by a PE firm, and it became this way because they no longer focus in on. When I say horizon 3, I'm also saying, like, focus on the user focusing in on what's next, too. So that's more often than not. Or  \n* you have a really strong, like a Moses trap where you had a really strong leader who instilled that thinking and didn't build up the organization. It was like, it was all based on that one person. Everyone learned that. That's where the innovation story came from. And then, as soon as that person left the role.  \n* it was like a gap  \n* right? There's a vacuum. And that next person that came in maybe was more of the operational person. So the you know, the Steve Jobs leaves  \n* and Tim comes in very operationally focused. Right? So different type of leader can also change that  \n* S-type innovation. So like really thinking through what those are as part of your thinking and making sure that those are brought into your interview questions as you're discussing with users and talking to them, thinking through a lot of those S type questions, not just the p-type questions. And then, lastly, prototyping.  \n* putting stimulus in front of users as you're building a product, you know, this is reinforced in design thinking, but like having that stimulus is so important because it will bring up things that just words can't.  \n* You're trying to solicit as much information to unlock the secret.  \n* and you need all the tools that you possibly can get. And so not just the interview questions. But what are the stimulus that you're putting in front of them so really like? Don't  \n* hold back your teams from putting something that's not complete so many. Oh, it's not perfect yet. I don't care. It might be really far from being the end solution, but it's something as a stimulus that just solicits something from our user that maybe questions on their own wouldn't have uncovered.  \n* There's a concept that is emerging and it's emerging like as we speak.  \n* And this idea of the Mvp. Going away  \n* and the Mvp. The minimum viable product, the lean, startup way of thinking was put into place because of economics.  \n* It costs a lot of money to build a software product, any product  \n* I've got to hire engineers designers. All this. It costs a lot of money to do.  \n* and a startup does not have a lot of money to start.  \n* so it needs to be as efficient as possible with the limited capital and resources it has. So it needs so much crazy focus. Born through the lean startup and the Mvp. Focus in on what's possible, and ship.  \n* We'll figure out the rest later.  \n* This was fine, except it really got away from building what I believe is the most important thing in that product which is making sure the users love it.  \n* Use the the product's the brand, the brand is the product. And if your if your customers love it really like, you'll solve many more problems down the road, enter in the minimum, lovable product which is saying, focus on those couple things that you totally love.  \n* and don't worry about anything else. Really focus on the delightful magic moments.  \n* Build a little bit more polish in the Ui and the ux. Don't ship something that looks a bit. Frankenstein put that extra care and craft  \n* into the product. So it's bringing back the craft, the artistry into product by saying, Build and ship a minimum lovable product, not a minimum viable product. And this is now changing yet again.  \n* And it's changing yet again, because the cost to ship a prototype  \n* has just gone to nearly 0,  \n* nearly 0\\. So if I can build a prototype for almost nothing, I could generate stimulus nearly instantaneous.  \n* I could ship hundreds, thousands of little mini, lovable products to use a stimulus and iterate so much more faster. I don't have to wait for all of this. Then let's go build a prototype, then take that and put it back in front of people  \n* I could.  \n* Today I couldn't have 4 months ago. But today.  \n* and I did this last week to test it.  \n* You can build a prototype as the customer is talking.  \n* So I was on a customer interview with Google, who is a client now.  \n* and as they were talking I had a product shipped and put back to them at the end of the call.  \n* fully fledged, working app completely based on the prompts of the questions I was asking and inspiration of other apps. Other brands.  \n* And so  \n* prototyping now is not just about the sequential aspect. It's about bringing that in real time, as a stimulus in your discovery sessions, and we now can bring in so many more rich insights and secrets we can unlock if we can hear their pains as we're talking, and basically just put something back in front of them. Right away. We unlock that next set  \n* of information, and so  \n* I don't have a name for it other than this. It's super basic. But for now I'm calling this generative agentic prototyping the idea that you can generate a workable clickable, not just like a looks like prototype, but a functioning product based upon an interview with a customer  \n* as they're talking in a half an hour  \n* discussion. At the end of that half an hour you could have an app sent right back to them that's being built as they chat.  \n* And so you can do this by 1st  \n* prompting this through your questions. So you're asking them the right questions. We're doing our normal customer discovery. We're digging in deep into the problems they're having. But we're also asking them for inspiration. So what are the other types of tools you use? What are the brands that you respect? We're trying to find some imagery. We're trying to find some creative energy and inspiration for our agents to build this  \n* prototype. So it's important that in this process you do ask some different types of questions as well. But with that we now have some branding and some visualization that we can add to it.  \n* We extract all of the transcript that's happening. As it's being done. So you need an AI translator which there are many. Firefly's AI has an Api that you can tap right into.  \n* There are many others.  \n* but whatever that is, you can have an AI transcript made available to you as you're talking, and you take that at whatever point in time that you're ready to start the prototype. Let's say, after a half an hour you've had some meaningful conversations, and you want to take a snapshot right then you feed that into an agent that says, Take all of this information, digest it and help me understand all the different, summarize all the different problems that this customer is having.  \n* Then you have another agent that takes the inputs. It's no longer the problem identification agent. It's the product concept generator agent. And it takes the inputs from the 1st one that says, I summarized all these problems and come up with a whole bunch of product concepts that might solve. This comes up with 4 or 5\\. Then you have another agent that goes ahead and reflects against those ideas, measures the best ones and picks one.  \n* This is the one that I think is the best based upon the input from the customer from this transcript, from the prompt of the interview guide from the prompt of what this team is looking at.  \n* Great. Here's a 1 page product, brief. By the way, I'm walking through the steps. This is happening in 3 seconds. Right? I mean, maybe not 3, 1010 seconds. But all these steps happen.  \n* You then feed that into a ui spec creator that takes that creates a ui spec, and in that it says and take inspiration from  \n* the brands the customer talked about the products they use. So I'm going out. I'm screen capturing screenshots from all of these different tools or brands. I'm taking imagery that I can pull in from all these brands.  \n* and I output into a ui spec.  \n* and I now get a full on generated ui from a tool.  \n* I take that ui as a Png, and I bring it into a code generation tool, and it builds that along with the prompt from the product spec and the ui spec. It builds a fully functioning app  \n* that happened in the span of about 45 seconds.  \n* and then I put the app back in front of the customer. And I'm like, all right. So like, imagine for a moment you had an app like this to talk about some of your problems and like, wait a second. I like literally just got done talking about this like, how is this possible? And all of a sudden we started unlocking more and more secrets.  \n* So this idea of just like it's not rapid prototyping. It's like instantaneous prototyping. And it's not just prototyping for like trying to get a product. It's just unlocked the secret.  \n* You're not. You're not actually going to ship this thing like this isn't the product like we have to put in the craft and the work into the product. But this helps me unlock the secret a lot faster, not a lot faster, infinitesimally faster than ever possible before.  \n* and the tools you can use to do this are these.  \n* Now, I'm not going to go show you how to do all of this.  \n* because part of this is putting in the work and the thinking through it.  \n* But I can tell you this, it's all possible to do.  \n* and it doesn't take an engineering degree degree to do it.  \n* And you can do this in your own company next week  \n* and implement these things. And these are happening. This is happening right now. Companies, leaders, innovators, businesses. The next unicorn has already been created, and it will be less than 5 people  \n* that will have that company.  \n* Instagram still holds the record. How many were they like 15 or 20 people when they got bought for  \n* 1 billion bucks? Right? So they hold the record for the smallest unicorn. But that will be broken  \n* and some of the the see in 2 weeks we're gonna bring in an innovator named Murph.  \n* and our AI Innovation Day. And he's gonna talk to you about his business. He's 2 people really like he's got some contractors, I think. And they're scaling their business with, just like.  \n* you know. I think he'll hire a couple more, but, like less than 5 people will be their entire company, and they will scale that.  \n* I think he's already on track to do like 3 or 4 million this year, but like he'll be easily at 10 million soon, and they will never really hire anybody else, because they are building this from the get, go like they are building as an AI Centric Agent Centric Company, where they can allow all of these things to be automated so fast  \n* that other companies will be really far behind unless they adopt these types of tools.  \n* And so I implore you to use them. If you attended the jetpack with me. Maybe a month ago or so. You probably saw some of these being used. If you want access to that Jetpack. Happy to do it. There is a ton of Youtube content. You're interested in actually building one of these out for yourself or for your company. Come, talk to me. I can help you with it. But no, this is going to be how other companies are operating  \n* like next month, the months to come.  \n* This is very centric for software development. Something like this for hardware.  \n* Yeah, so hardware is fall is like a slight bit behind. But there are new tools that are being released just last month there was a 1 that plugs into solidworks for mechanical engineers that does essentially the same.  \n* so it will go off and build an entire mechanical spec.  \n* and then you can ship that, and you can prompt it to be like, Hey, make this, you know, 3D printable for now, so that the tools and the parts aren't like overly complicated to be sent to a 3D. Printer, and they could sit off and 3D print it, and you could essentially, in a prompt have something generated.  \n* Very simple.  \n* I'll have to go. I'll have let me take the action to get the tool name.  \n* Actually, while you're sitting here, let me see.  \n* I'll tell you what, at break I'll I'll at break. I'll get you the the name of the tool.  \n* You may have already found it.  \n* Okay. So we talked a little bit about this. Here's a nice graphic that represents it. But all of this is to say, like this is reinforcing what I mentioned that this idea of an Mvp. Is dying.  \n* And so like, that's the uber takeaway here is that like it's not enough to ship something that's just possible like  \n* that. Those days are over  \n* the days of the Mlp. Yes, great, awesome. Putting the user forward putting in the craft.  \n* But that's even dead. And the reason why and you think about this is like they just ship a little bit of what's possible a little bit that's functional and really focus in on having this delightful experience. And with copilots with AI tools, this new thing, whatever this new thing is going to be called. I can come up with names. It doesn't matter. But this new way  \n* is going to be not just a lovable product, but like fully functioning, fully built out and beautiful. And that's your new Mvp.  \n* And that's what the new companies are going to be shipping like. That's what the competition is going to be shipping. They're not going to be shipping the stuff on the left. They're going to be shipping the stuff on the right.  \n* and they're going to be doing it with less people and less resources.  \n* You no longer need to go out and say I'm raising a seed round for 3 million dollars or 2 million dollars like you can go out to market with a product that's already built with just an angel round. And now we're talking to our bosses, our Vcs about these are the customers I've generated. This is the revenue I'm making.  \n* So evolving this. This idea means  \n* this rapid research design build, taking the stuff from Joellen and Elisa, interjecting that in, but not just sequentially then waiting. It's like iterating in the discussion or immediately after, and going back to field again. This Rdb cycle that's nearly instantaneous. Then continuing to refine, focusing in on a lovable product the craft.  \n* the experience putting the user forward.  \n* The idea of agentic prototyping. All of this is meant to inspire you because there is no, there is no process yet.  \n* Job roles are about to change. I think that is now becoming a fairly wide held view across  \n* tech leaders, design leaders, product leaders and Vcs is that the idea of a product manager is going to be very different in the next 12 to 24 months  \n* in at least, the forward thinking companies and the reason being is that the product. Managers of next  \n* have tools they never had before, and can ship things themselves  \n* to start to validate their hypotheses.  \n* They likely won't ship the full product.  \n* but they will be able to maximize the chance of success  \n* by being able to ship a fully working product that will help to explain  \n* with the why the what and the how to the other stakeholders. They need to bring along the journey  \n* and not too far down the line. We probably will have also hybrid engineer product roles that will be able to ship the full product so they could take the code base generated by the Pm. Import it in, and then they, by a solo Eng, can ship the full product themselves.  \n* I am in the process right now of building a tool for all of you, an app to use a research app. It's sort of taking the inspiration of  \n* perplexity plus notebook. Lm, plus deep research and combining that into one tool. The prompt, for this is that  \n* there is a trap to become lazy with research with these tools, because the information is summarized. So I might see the sources. But there is something about actually seeing the real source, like what the customer actually said, that these tools abstract.  \n* They summarize the information. They may say. I summarized it from these places  \n* cool, but I'm missing that that the actual reading of what they said is missing in my synthesis.  \n* And so this tool will bring in the actual sources. Not just this is the document it came from, but we'll start to quote exactly what customers said with any prompt you get it across the web. This is a product that would maybe a year ago  \n* I thought about and would probably take 10 to 20 people. I'd have to go raise a few 1 million dollars like I've built this product over the past week so far, and it's like pretty good right now with one person and it like probably would have taken me about 2 million dollars to build last year. That's the scale in which we're talking about like and what you can do.  \n* And so when we think about our capstones like, really, really challenge yourself.  \n* do the extra homework because it's going to benefit your job and what you do next out of this program.  \n* if you use these tools and you go through capstone, and you actually can build a real product, not just pitch what it could be and give some mocks, but actually have some real working product.  \n* You will have demonstrated all of these skills that will be immediately applicable to any role, not only that you go back into, but that you want to differentiate yourself to into a new role where you can say, Listen, people are talking about the new role of a Pm. I'm living it. And here's how I did it. And here's what I did.  \n* It will make you so much more valuable as a product leader, as a designer or as an engineer than the rest of your peers.  \n* I guarantee them.  \n* Okay. So the next part of our discussion before we move into our guest. Speaker Kieran, you guys have already spent some time with the jobs framework, which is amazing. There are other user centric approaches that your organization may use you may choose to use later. They all have their strengths. I do like the jobs framework because it does allow us to think a little bit more about the context.  \n* And it's really meant to help uncover that secret like, how are you solving this problem today? It starts to show you who your competition really is. And so an example with Geobit. When we adopted this was, we really got into that idea of peace of mind. But then, when you went a step further, it was really about anxiety.  \n* It was. Parents have a lot of anxiety, and we're helping them solve some of that anxiety. And if we're solving anxiety, we actually don't compete with other GPS trackers. We compete with Thc.  \n* We compete with alcohol. We compete with therapists we compete like.  \n* Wow, that's a totally different way to think about your product and who you're really competing with. If you're really solving anxiety. And so think about it through this lens of like, what's that secret? And using a job to help you uncover that secret?  \n* And hopefully, this just jogs your memory about how to think about these aspects. The emotional side is the inward facing kind of discovery, and what we're trying to find out from customers like, what are the emotions they have during this journey? It's not so much about segmentation, it's about trying to understand. What's the emotional aspect? What's the motivation? And what's the situation that they are in, that is causing some of these emotions where the social pressures on them  \n* that may be coming. Using that example I mentioned. Like we had this emotional journey of this woman who was very worried about her, her child. She was very worried about sort of  \n* her feeling of not being more social. The judgment being there. The situation she was in all these things helped us uncover more and more insights and in the jobs framework. Of course, in the book, the innovative solution. They talk about the milkshake example. Who remembers the milkshake example  \n* created like multiple sections of directories.  \n* yep, yep, that's right. So they focused on the product added some flavors that didn't work. They focused on some of the things around the market, the customer. None of these things really worked. They had to understand the situation that all these customers were in which was commuting, and they needed to build something that allowed them to solve that problem at hand, which was, they weren't just trying to to have a beverage. They're hiring something to make their commute more tolerable.  \n* And so when we think about this, they didn't really care about this taste. They didn't care about these other features. They carried about some of the functional purposes of what it was trying to solve made it better than some of the substitutes, and that Job was making their drive to work less boring.  \n* So as we think about this like these very simple ways as we think of our capstone. This is going to be some of the exercise that we're going to do after break is we're going to start to split back into teams. And I want you guys to really start thinking through the jobs framework with your capstone. So start thinking through when something happens.  \n* So this is the situation they're in. And before you do this, it's also helpful to talk about who it is. I am a mother of 3\\. I am a like, who are they? The context is key, the situation. They're in the motivation. I want to do these things.  \n* and what is the outcome of that? And you aren't going to have one. You'll have many. So I'd expect you guys to come up with a list. It may be 3\\. It may be 10, maybe 20, like the number isn't there? But it's not just one. And so we want you guys to start really thinking through what that is for your capstone. Of course, also think about it through the 5 whys. This is just some examples with using the air, or the  \n* the wired versions before. I can't remember what they were called just the apple headphones before air pods.  \n* and or ear pods, or whatever the hell they're called and so this is like, how you would normally think about it is like.  \n* it's not that they just want it for running. It's like, because I think I'm cool, like, when you really ask the why like, really get at the why, when you start thinking about that in the customer interrogation. So we're gonna take a 5 min break. Karen will be here at 10, and then after that break, we're going to do some exercise in the teams through jobs in Capstone. Okay, go get some coffee. Go use the bathroom. We'll be back in 5, 6, 7 min.  \n* Yeah, yeah. Okay, yeah.  \n* All right, everybody. We're gonna go ahead and get started.  \n* Let's take our seats  \n* all right. We're going to be moving on to our our next guest speaker. As I mentioned.  \n* our next speaker is Kieran Kurpakaran. Kieran is an alumni of this program of Mpd. He's spent  \n* his years since then at a number of different companies, Apple, Nike, and and most recently, as I mentioned, he's joined Airbnb in their product organization. We talked a little bit about how the product organization Airbnb has transformed  \n* from a more traditional product management to like a product marketing focus, how some of those folks now are within the Cmo. And in the marketing organization start talking about the go to market alongside the the product development.  \n* So we know a little bit about the background of the company. Now, Kieran is here to really give you the insider view about how innovation is managed inside of Airbnb and really focusing in on the power of why  \n* the power of why, in inspiring the organization along that vision. And so Kieran has been very gracious with his time to to join us. We're gonna spend about a half an hour to 40 min with Kieran, and then maybe about 5 to 10 min of QA. And then we'll take another another break. So with that Kieran over to you, can you hear us? Okay.  \n* ![Kiran Kripakaran][image2]  \n* **Kiran Kripakaran**  \n* 01:24:04  \n* I can hear you all great. How about myself?  \n* ![John Renaldi][image3]  \n* **John Renaldi**  \n* 01:24:07  \n* Yes, let me just figure out how to PIN you on the screen, and we'll be good to go.  \n* ![Kiran Kripakaran][image4]  \n* **Kiran Kripakaran**  \n* 01:24:13  \n* I was actually happy with my video being smaller.  \n* ![John Renaldi][image5]  \n* **John Renaldi**  \n* 01:24:16  \n* Oh, yeah, you okay, you are. That's cool, you are, you are, I know.  \n* So got it. Never mind, that's your side, not mine. So with that Kieran over to over to you.  \n* ![Kiran Kripakaran][image6]  \n* **Kiran Kripakaran**  \n* 01:24:25  \n* Awesome.  \n* Hey? Everybody nice to see. You all. Can't see everybody. But good morning for me. I think it's almost afternoon for y'all yeah, like John mentioned.  \n* Yeah, we're gonna go through a little bit about Airbnb today. I'll just touch on my background a little bit, just a little about me, and we can get into the work. But  \n* yeah, I've been a pro product marketing and Airbnb for about  \n* 6 months now, and we'll talk a little bit more about you know. Why, it's called product marketing. How it differs from product management, how it relates to innovation in the consumer in a little bit as well. But you know, been in product for about 15 years. I'm from Springfield, Illinois, was in Chicago for a long time didn't do. My master's in Northwestern but started off in hardware product management actually built  \n* Bluetooth speakers and Walkie talkies and whatnot, and then slowly transitioned into software. Found my way to California at Apple and been, you know, in a multitude of different types of places, and before I get into that really quickly.  \n* I have a 2 and a half year old. My wife is Catherine. That little one is Rowan. I love sports. play basketball. Run, lift and you know, love technology and everything that's there with it. So I'm I'm lucky to be at the company as I am, because professionally and personally, I get to work on a lot of products that I actually love using so  \n* like I said, a long tenured career.  \n* I you know, I I just want to reinforce that mpd really was a a juxtaposition on  \n* kind of change, the trajectory of my career and what I wanted to do and doing this program and it really what brought me out West, and I've been. I've been out West for the past 10 years, gotten to work on a lot of cool products. So  \n* as we go through this, if you all have any other questions, I'm gonna talk a little bit about differences between Nike and Airbnb, and even Apple but if you have any specific questions on products I've worked on, or how it relates to the the course that y'all are in right now, or what I'm talking about. Please don't hesitate to ask. So  \n* I'm on Airbn. I'm at Airbnb today.  \n* I'm a lead product marketing manager for experiences. So the team that I work on our experiences. Most people know Airbnb for stays  \n* but we're actually relaunching experiences this year. And so I was hired on in the summer to come. Relaunch experiences later this year. And so a lot of the things I'll be talking about is related to that, but also just the overall company. But that's what that's what I'm focused on.  \n* I think when John and I were talking, you know, we really, I think he asked me a lot of great questions, and I kept coming back to answering it in a way that reflected and again, credit to John who brought up this framework. But Simon Sinek has this great framework of called the Golden Circle on on the why and because of the why it kind of permeates to how you do it, and then actually what you do for the consumers and the jobs to be done. And so I tried to structure my thinking  \n* in in that relation and then also apply it back to what? What you guys are learning these days. So I'm gonna start with the why and really.  \n* specifically about Airbnb.  \n* So Airbnb, in the last 15 years. There's been a single thread in terms of  \n* what they believe is the most important thing to him specifically the founders. And and more specifically, Brian Chesky. Brian is still the CEO and founder of the company. and he's all. It's he connects everything he does back to his. Why, which is he wants us to create human connection. It's about connection and belonging  \n* and everything he's done from homes all the way to what we're gonna launch in the next 3 to 5 years. It goes back to human connection and human belonging  \n* even with stays  \n* and maybe a quick raise of hands who stayed at an airbnb before. I can't see everybody. Okay, so good. Good amount of you. You know he he's always wanted to differentiate Airbnb from Vrbo. you know, hotels, Tripadvisor. All these other traveling platforms out there, because at the central point of of accommodations and stays were the host.  \n* And this idea of that you get to know the host before you go to your stay. While you're at the at that, their home and it's about that human connection this understanding of Hey, you're you're in somebody else's house. They're there to welcome you.  \n* They want you to get to know a sense of the neighborhood of the city you're visiting, and really feel a lot more community than you would if you went to a hotel, or if you stayed at a Vrbido. And even if you look at how those products are manifested to the consumer online. It's very apparent if you go to airbnb.com and look for a home  \n* versus Vrbo, or versus a hotel. What you'll see is, there's a lot more warmth. There's a lot more understanding of the person that actually owns that home that wants to host you.  \n* The way we we write our copy the way we do our imagery. It all represents back to this. Why, of why we show up the way to the consumer, and why we believe that human connection is so important.  \n* so highest level. That's Airbnb's. Why. And that kind of really reflects back to how  \n* our company operates, which is what I'm going to talk about next and how that relates to innovation. And you know what was what was super interesting to hear. John on on with with this class was  \n* this idea of a human centered innovation. And I couldn't think of a better company than Airbnb on how  \n* innovation product launches, how we think about solving problems comes back to.  \n* you know, one, the consumer, and what they're focused on. But also, you know, I also thought about it in the in the realm of like Brian, and how he sees himself as a consumer. He sees himself as part of the company, and what he wants to drive forward in making sure that we put something amazing out there. So  \n* I'll pause there for a second. Any questions on  \n* Airbnb's. Why or does this make sense, or any other, any other clarifications.  \n* ![John Renaldi][image7]  \n* **John Renaldi**  \n* 01:31:14  \n* Quick question. Can you hear me, Karen?  \n* ![Kiran Kripakaran][image8]  \n* **Kiran Kripakaran**  \n* 01:31:20  \n* Yeah, yeah.  \n* ![John Renaldi][image9]  \n* **John Renaldi**  \n* 01:31:21  \n* Cool.  \n* So  \n* there's been like a big kind of professionalization of there. There are a lot of like management companies that  \n* they they invest in properties. And and then you have, you know, like cleaning services that have pop up for specifically for Airbnb, and sort of become more like.  \n* you know, more more like like a hotel in in a lot of ways, I think I mean is this, I guess. How? How do you reconcile this? You know this mission against sort of what it's what it's become.  \n* ![Kiran Kripakaran][image10]  \n* **Kiran Kripakaran**  \n* 01:31:50  \n* And you know it's a great point. There are professional hosts that this is their full time job, and they've  \n* have multiple properties that they're managing.  \n* You also have some hosts on the platform that have a business face that also manage multiple properties.  \n* And you know, we at the end of the day  \n* stays our marketplace, and we, you know it's an it's it's a. It's a somewhat open slash, managed marketplace. And we allow those things we've we've built features over the last. Let's say 5 to 10 years to support  \n* what you're saying is happening so that it doesn't lose that human face of it.  \n* And one aspect of it is, we have Co host. So sometimes when you see these listings, even though you see a business profile, or you see multiple individuals we tried to highlight. Who's who? That's managing that that location and why they're involved? We actually launched Co Host Network at the end of last year, which was to  \n* kind of I wouldn't say it's a problem, but kind of improve upon something that we felt we we could do better than what's out there. And so what we launched with the Co host network. Was this idea of that  \n* we're going to, you know. Put a stamp behind the people that could manage listings for you.  \n* So instead of me trying to manage 3 or 4 listings and say, or I think the way we're thinking about it is one. Sometimes people are just too scared to manage their own listing. 2\\. There are some people that are managing multiple listings and aren't doing a good job because it is a lot of work.  \n* And so we created this network of, I think it's about 8,000 Co hosts around the world that you can hire to manage your listing. They have a robust profile about them, a background history.  \n* They represent your listing on behalf of you. But do it in a way that you know they're way more professionally capable to doing it. But there's still a human face to that. And so I I think it. That still happens on the marketplace. There are a little bit of businesses and whatnot, and we need to. I think we're also thinking about, how do we create a business profile? For for our other lines of businesses versus stays. But  \n* even even if you see, a management company, or, you see, multiple hosts.  \n* What you'll notice is that we require them to include background description on who they are. We do identity verification to make sure that it's an actual person that's behind that business profile. We do a lot of vetting through the publishing process and operational process before that listing ever goes, live on the marketplace, and then, when it's live, it's managed  \n* constantly to make sure that we don't have bad actors. So we still try to maintain that idea of human connection, and that there's visibility and transparency on who you're working with. So  \n* it's a great question, though. I think as we scale those, those are the types of problems we run into. And we try to solve pass. So  \n* okay, I'm gonna get into the how as well. And John keep nudging me along if I keep talking too much on a specific topic.  \n* I wanted to give you guys a little bit of just inside of the org structure. And what I did was, you know, Brian and Hiroki have done some great podcasts, and I pulled some quotes from these podcasts and a way to let you all hear the actual statement that they made. And I can kind of talk a little bit more about it, and we can ask some questions. So I reported to Hiroki.  \n* product marketing design research and Marcom marketing communications all report up into Hiroki. This was an explicit decision made by Brian. That he wanted a functional organization across the company.  \n* and he wanted to make sure that the creative side of the organization had product in it.  \n* So product marketing sits next to product design, sits next to marketing communications and sits next to the whole research org. And there's a reason for that. And he's gonna speak to it. But it's really powerful in how we think about building products, innovating and delivering for the consumer at the end.  \n* Now, what's really interesting about my group and the the role we sit across the company in this functional organization is that there's 2, 3 legged sides of the stool. So traditional product is is sitting between design and engineering. But we also have supply and business on the other side. So I was telling John  \n* we did a mid journey render. It would probably be one of the ugliest stools ever. But we're this, you know, we're we're this middle point of a 3 legged stool across, you know, 4 other organizations to bring products to life.  \n* And I think most people know design and engineering. I'll just give you a, you know. Quick recap on supply and business supply teams are the ones that go get supply, whether that stays. Whether that's experiences or whether that's services, the supply team goes and gets it. The business team helps us build the business models,  \n* presents the actual point of view on like. Is this a. Is the juice worth the squeeze? On going after this feature, going after this product line? Doing what we need to. And so this 3 legged stool on both sides is really what helps bring ideas to life. So  \n* I'm gonna start playing some stuff and let me, John, let me know if this comes through, I'm gonna start with this one. So this is just a recap of what product marketing is for Brian, or how Brian sees product marketing within Airbnb, the business function, the business function is quite literally the counterpart  \n* was that was that coming through.  \n* ![John Renaldi][image11]  \n* **John Renaldi**  \n* 01:37:36  \n* That's good.  \n* ![Kiran Kripakaran][image12]  \n* **Kiran Kripakaran**  \n* 01:37:37  \n* Let me  \n* the business function. The business function is quite literally the counterpart, the business counterpart to product marketing. So if product marketing is basically nouveau product management product marketing is basically product management minus program management plus some outbound marketing. And it's fewer people, that's all it is. And it's outbound, inbound in one role.  \n* They are really thinking about what the customer wants, what the experience should be like. But they're not in spreadsheets. They're not business model people. So they have a counterpart called the business function.  \n* So I wanted to give that explanation because product marketing is a little different than than other product functions I've been in at Nike and at Apple as well. Apple is the most  \n* closely resembles what we do at Airbnb, but we own inbound and outbound. Inbound are, you know? Think of just, you know, insights coming in as we think about how we build a product internally. How do we communicate back into the company to bring the voice of the consumer to what we want to build  \n* into our product. Outbound is, how do we story, tell what we want to deliver to the consumer? In external marketing, to the press, to consumers outside? How do we actually tell the story and and make sure that we're controlling what message and how people understand what products is coming out the door. And so we own, inbound and outbound. And so everything really funnels through product marketing.  \n* And this could be a an idea, that is, you know.  \n* it. It starts from research and it. And it  \n* can permeate into a 1 year roadmap or 2 year roadmap or or you know, and we think 3 years out. So I know John. References. Horizon one and 2 and 3 we we mainly focus on like I almost wanna say one and a half  \n* one half and 2\\. We we don't do iterate iterative product product development that often, I think about 10 to 20% of our capacity is around. I'd say 10% of our capacity is around a B testing a lot of our capacity is really thinking about the next 2 releases that are out there within a year or a year and a half.  \n* and and I'll play something that Brian will kind of speak to a little bit more. But any any questions on product marketing and how it differs from other other product  \n* management organizations you guys have learned about, or a part of.  \n* ![John Renaldi][image13]  \n* **John Renaldi**  \n* 01:40:08  \n* Might be more questions, I think, at the end, as you kind of think.  \n* ![Kiran Kripakaran][image14]  \n* **Kiran Kripakaran**  \n* 01:40:11  \n* Okay, cool.  \n* So this as I talked to you all about  \n* our organization, and you know how we sit under the global head of marketing hierarchy. It's really interesting to understand why we sit the way we do. It's really about how this one insight helps fuel  \n* roadmaps, whether it be 1, 2, or 3 years out, so I'll send to Hiroki. On speaking to that of teams they manage, and then primary teams that they work with like we do at Airbnb. It creates that adjacency, you know. And so we have our research and insights team literally sitting right with our leads of the advertising group with the marketing group, with the design group, with the product group and all the insights that they gain through their separate functions.  \n* working against a larger set of insights feed each other, you know, and so interesting advertising ideas come from a design, exploration or a design insight, interesting  \n* feature. Ideas may come from something that you know the marketing and advertising teams have discovered in the behavior of people. And so  \n* that adjacency is super super critical, and you have to have a really simple organization, a really simple roadmap, and a really simple set of goals in order to  \n* let that adjacency kind of magic happen that.  \n* Yeah. So I I didn't fully, you know, embrace the power of this till I've been in the company. But our research group.  \n* is a pretty pretty, you know small group, but you know, they're they really help fuel. All the insights that cut through and how we deliver product to the consumer.  \n* We.  \n* you know we start from a singular insight about the guests, and you'll you'll hear me say, guests. That's how we refer to the consumer. We also talk about hosts who are on our platform.  \n* These research insights reference, both host and guests  \n* it it what helps fuels the ideas on what we do next on our roadmap which I'll get to next. But what's really powerful is that because the insight is singularly  \n* cuts through all these organizations  \n* the way we you know the way that the problem comes through the way that design and product think about the idea and how to solve for it. You know, product writes the brief against the insight design builds the user experience to solve against that problem. Engineering builds technology.  \n* and create something really magical that can help bring that design experience to life. And then marketing uses that same insight to talk about the problem that we're solving and the way we're solving it with the product that we're launching out the door.  \n* and it helps so much in terms of making sure everybody is aligned on what the problem is and what we're trying to solve.  \n* I'm even to where  \n* you'll notice. With our marketing communications, you can look back on our previous releases, or, you know, get ready for our launches this year.  \n* The way we talk about the product at a keynote to the consumer, to the press is the way we honestly talk about it internally. We we really think about?  \n* What do we call this feature? How do we like? Can we can we clarify what it means internally before we even talk about it to the consumer. We understand it so deeply from a consumer lens internally before we actually put it out the door. And so this process is inside these functions. Sitting. So, you know, close in an adjacency, really helps us do that to deliver to the consumer. And it's a really powerful way to work. And it also works for how we think about the roadmap which I'll talk about next, which is.  \n* you know.  \n* these insights fuel the roadmaps that we have, and we're on this 2 release cadence a year, and I'll kind of let you understand what that is. We also do. This thing called a roadmap review  \n* twice a year we gather all the top leaders in the company, like like, or many of the top people in the company, and that are working on the roadmap like 75, 80 people, and we spend days together just going through every single thing. So but the answer, maybe maybe the final answer to your question, is that  \n* so? We do a roadmap review twice a year that fuels the actual releases that come come forward. So these roadmap reviews are moments in time, where we talk about the next release and what we're launching and  \n* how we're talking about it. And we do it about 6 months out. So here's an opportunity to influence  \n* the actual development cycle so that we can make sure it's right. And then we talk about what's coming. The release  \n* the year after. And it's usually, you know. He said, 75, 80 people. But it's actually about 100 of Brian's top leaders in the company that comes to the Roadmap Review to really think about, how do we plan for the future of the company? And what's what's ahead of us? And they talk about like I said, everything from the release coming up to the release after. And then also big ideas that we're gonna go after down the road.  \n* And then this is kind of that release cadence that follows that roadmap review. We now do 2 releases a year. The reason we're talking is because we just did our summer release for May. And what we found is this, when I told people in the La about this development process, the 1st thing everyone said is this is going to be horrible. No one's going to want to work together. It's going to stifle innovation. It's going to be too top down. You're not going to have as many ideas. It's going to be a bottleneck, etc, etc. I can tell you all the reasons. This is a bad idea.  \n* What we found is we ship way faster. We have now shipped 340 upgrades. We shipped over 53 upgrades today it creates a drumbeat for their organization, a rhythm. There is very little bureaucracy now. We do say no to more things. There are some downsides like. You can't do as many divergent things, because everything is cohesive and integrated. But anything on the roadmap ships almost never do we green light something, and it doesn't happen. So the answer to your question we've been able to ship significantly.  \n* So I I put a lot at you. The last 2 quotes. But  \n* essentially, you know, we, the company is organized in a way to release twice a year.  \n* We have a summer release right before the travel season, which is one of our biggest seasons, and then we have a winter release. It's a little bit smaller.  \n* and this it's called the one Company Roadmap  \n* and you know, funny enough, it's actually printed out. Brian prints this out like there's a culture at Apple. And then we it's brought over to Airbnb. We do a lot of boards where we print a lot of things out. Not everything is just in figma and just on screens, and he has this massive roadmap on on the wall. That speaks to all the functions and everything we're doing to ladder up to the actual release. And so we do 2 releases a year creates this heartbeat for the company. Everyone is  \n* organize around these roadmaps. And around these 2, we, you know, talking to John about this. We we're about 2 to 3 releases out. Majority of the team is working on the next release. You have some folks that already know that a couple of things are moving to the second release, and we have a a tiny few that are focused on like the the 3rd release out, which is about 2 2 years out, and  \n* what this drumbeat allows is.  \n* you know, I spend little to no time convincing people in the organization whether this is a good idea or no or no, no, a bad idea. Like I am. Everyone is bought in on. These are the things that we want to do, because a lot of it is, you know, there is this top down leadership kind of sounds negative. But there's a vision that Brian has in what he wants to achieve for the company. It's all based on that. Why of he wants to create human connection.  \n* And  \n* with that why he he is really involved. With understanding how we build product to serve that mission.  \n* And you know, his big focus now is, he uses the analogy that when Amazon 1st launched decades ago, they were just an online book company book distribution company that obviously changed. And they went from books to Cds to now they sell everything right. That's why they call themselves the A to Z store.  \n* And Airbnb is kind of in that inflection point of we started with homes and accommodations. But we really want to move to different business lines and verticals as we think about how the brand can expand. But it's all based on that. Why, of it needs to be about human connection.  \n* And so that influences and fuels the roadmap one to 3 years out and he's.  \n* He's very explicit on  \n* what he thinks the product can do to solve these problems. He leaves room for us to really think about. How do we creatively solve those. You know. What's the feature called like? How do we build it within the constraints of time? Because we're on this release? Schedule? Is there something? Is there a better way? We can bring it to life. But he actually ensures that  \n* he reviews all these ideas before they're put on the roadmap, and when they're prioritizing the roadmap, he believes in it. And so the company believes in it, and there's nothing somebody's working on in the company that isn't believe, you know, it isn't something that Brian wants, or his leadership hierarchy or my Vp. Judd doesn't want either. And so it's a really powerful culture, and where  \n* we're spending less time in the politics, less time in the influencing of budgets and whatnot. It's really influencing, like, what is the best way to solve this problem for the guests. And how do we bring this to life in the most magical way possible for that release?  \n* And so this roadmap really drives an amazing machine of the company and a really great culture  \n* and even one of the things that you know is is kind of far out. You know. And this is where I want to get into kind of like, what like, what are we actually delivering? And what's the product?  \n* This, this whole culture really influences feature, level things going after new businesses.  \n* Thinking about how AI could become part of the  \n* the the app and the company and the way the the company is structured is that product marketing. 80 and 90%, like I said, is focused on the release ahead of us and a little bit about the release at the end of the year. And so right now we have, like a May ish release that is coming up. We also have a winter release, and majority of the company is really focused on May. We're kind of in launch mode as we get closer to the summer, and then we're also there's some teams thinking about winter. But there is a team thinking about AI thinking about.  \n* long range initiatives that I can't speak about fully that is carved off from the You know. Horizon 1, 2 teams they're they're a little bit away from. I think the like launch machine. But what's crazy is Brian does.  \n* Brian has 3 days every week where he does CEO workshops. He reviews from leaders across all the functions, across the company to teams. Where we present the work to him on what's happening for the release or the launch, or what's coming up down the road. And so, even though, that we have some groups that are  \n* little siphoned off the the Overall product development pipeline, they still review with Brian. Because Brian is has green lit that has invested in that has an idea of when he wants to bring that life to the market and wants to review it early and often. As it makes its way back into kind of the launch machine that we we kind of that, I'm more a part of  \n* but that's that's kind of how we think about releases and how we start to bring product to life. But it's it's so orchestrated.  \n* It's it's a really. It's a very stressful  \n* I've not worked this hard in my life in a long time. But it's it's great. I think the the culture is just that everybody's bought in. Everybody wants to do this thing, and we're doing daunting huge, daunting things. For these releases, because Brian really believes in it. And and there's a strong why on how we're gonna do it.  \n* So last thing I'll touch on is the what I use an example for, you know, a couple of years ago we launched rooms. And this really came to life, or they relaunch rooms. It came to life as an insight. From you know  \n* the market, you know, we're coming out of covid people still want affordable pricing for accommodation. And what's you know? What can we do to help support that? And then what was the problem with rooms when we 1st you know what Brian 1st launched rooms. When Airbnb 1st started, it wasn't actually whole homes like it started with a room and then and then it ended up becoming a whole home. And I think what was really interesting with that insight, and how they innovated on this idea. And it. I think they did it all through. Covid.  \n* It took them years to kind of figure this out, but the idea was that  \n* they wanted to relaunch rooms with a whole new way to merchandise the product  \n* on the Pdp really, to ensure that they're meeting all these different needs and jobs to be done, that the guest was looking for and on the guest side it was very much. Hey? When you go and stay in a room.  \n* A lot of it is unknown, like, you know. Is there a bathroom there? You know. Where is it in the house? Is it private? Is it actually in a shared space, what is gonna feel like? And then also like, Who's the host? And can I know more about the host? And so what happened with this launch was, not only did we relaunch Airbnb rooms and create a whole new merchandising platform, but we also  \n* launched host passport  \n* we always used to have profile but actually with rooms they they created a whole a way more robust.  \n* profile experience that they call the host passport that was really to give an opportunity on. Who is the host, and how do they get to know them? And this was a huge idea that kind of helped us really build passport out. Now, password actually is there for guests as well. So that it's it's 2 sided. Not only can guests know a lot about the host, but the host can also know a lot about the guests before they allow you to book an accommodation. And so this was an insight that came about that like, I said, connected back to Brian's. Why.  \n* and and then the  \n* company, really shifting everything to help support launching, of relaunching, of Airbnb rooms that happened a couple of years ago.  \n* The last thing I'll touch on. And there's a lot of product ideas can talk about that can kind of go back to the frameworks, but is about something long range, which is you know, hasn't specifically talked about it, but I think he does talk about things that he wants to do long range, and how I wanted to speak about how innovation is still built into the company. That's that's very much focused on a release cycle.  \n* And so I think the lesson here is that this technology is going to have a much bigger impact on society than probably think. But it's what's that old saying you overestimate what you can done in a year, and you underestimate what's possible in 10 years. I think we in silicon value that all the time we invent a technology. And we think society is just going to adopt it. And it's going to take a lot longer, and so  \n* I think that all of us were way too Pollyannish, when chat should be launched, and I think we all thought all of our businesses were going to change in 3 or 4 years, and honestly like, if I just like, I don't know. Here's a good test. I open my phone, I look at the apps on my home screen. I asked, how many of these apps have fundamentally changed because of generative AI.  \n* So I'll I'll end on that because  \n* you know, he believes AI is gonna dramatically shift.  \n* How people engage with Airbnb. He just doesn't think that it's something that we need to do immediately right now. And he has teams working on how we think about that. You know, down the road, and how that's gonna the the analogy uses is is, yeah. You know, if if any of us will open an app today.  \n* has it fundamentally changed, and how the ux shows up to the consumer, or how our interaction patterns are with an app like it really hasn't and that's what's going to be transformational, is that, you know, AI is gonna trans should transform an app in a way that people can't recognize it. That really is something innovative and pushing boundaries, and  \n* I think he believes this is the right thing to do for the company based on the why.  \n* He believes that it's not ready for the near term as as he mentioned. Like we underest, you know, we overestimate what we can do in a year, and we understand what we can do in 10 years. And so this is a long horizon initiative that he believes we need to invest in and and understand and know that we need to have a moment in time where we do bring it to life.  \n* And it's something that's going to transform how we think about Airbnb  \n* and he actually mentioned that one of the initial ways it's going to transform Airbnb is actually more customer support.  \n* We can do a far better job of handling the millions of calls and messages we get from a customer service standpoint in a way that you know, AI can really help us be a lot more human to be honest than support articles. And these things like, how can we be a little more human? And how we show up to the consumer? And that's something that's, gonna you know, launch a little bit sooner. But how it transforms the app is gonna be a long time. And so  \n* yeah, you know, I I think it's already been 35 min. So I wanted to leave time for questions, and I went through a lot. So please ask any questions, and John direct me in any way to clarify anything.  \n* ![John Renaldi][image15]  \n* **John Renaldi**  \n* 01:57:52  \n* Awesome. Thank you. Thank you so much round of applause for hearing.  \n* We're open up for some questions. I have a few that I love. But I want to make sure students get a chance to ask you as well. So yeah, Karen, thank you so much for that presentation. I think what we're also impressed is to see that  \n* you move into 3 different industries from like from apple to Nike to to Airbnb. But like all around product  \n* product management and product marketing. I'm curious.  \n* In your experience, like, Have you have, you felt that there are some things that you've learned in Airbnb potentially could be transferred to places like Nike and Apple that could help them reinforce more are being more user, centric, or or get away. Have you felt that the experience around innovation and thinking about the product has been consistent across these 3 different companies.  \n* ![Kiran Kripakaran][image16]  \n* **Kiran Kripakaran**  \n* 01:58:52  \n* Yeah, you know, I I firmly believe in the functional model. And I believe that you know.  \n* There should be a editor in chief, that kind of sees how product goes out the door.  \n* and a functional model is best suited to do that.  \n* and in some way, shape or form. I hope you know companies see the benefits of that versus a divisional model, and how to bring that. You know it's not perfect for every industry. But there's ways to enact that culture. And I think that's 1 big way to  \n* you know. Carry over you know, across those 3 companies.  \n* I think there's a personal gravitation towards those 3, but I  \n* I firmly believe in this is  \n* like, I deeply care about what you put out in the world, and I  \n* I I would not be able to work for a company that didn't deeply care about the product they put on the world, the marketing, the messaging and you know, and so for me, like this high quality.  \n* premiumness of being very thoughtful on what you put out in the world is really important and having a culture that really really focuses on the product. And the consumer is something that's really important to me. And that's something that's been the same in different fashions across Apple Nike and Airbnb.  \n* ![John Renaldi][image17]  \n* **John Renaldi**  \n* 02:00:14  \n* So we heard a lot about like Airbnb's experimentation culture like,  \n* having like a 90% failure rate. I haven't read that somewhere. So how do you foster that kind of experimentation culture and this  \n* Dmm teams encourage that in some way, or have an impact on the experimentations that the rapid experimentation that's.  \n* ![Kiran Kripakaran][image18]  \n* **Kiran Kripakaran**  \n* 02:00:35  \n* Yeah, and hope. I think I heard you right. But just, I want to clarify 80% of what we do is not experimentation. So we are majority, you know, a release based company similar to apple.  \n* we launch product. We may, you know, we build in capacity to maintain what we launch and manage it. But majority of the resources are going into building new things  \n* versus A B testing a lot of iterative things.  \n* But that doesn't mean we don't have an experimentation culture. I think when there is a complete unknown that has a significant impact potential impact to the business, we choose to a B test.  \n* But  \n* but our our positioning and our like belief is that you know, if you can't research deeply and understand the consumer deeply, or the host enough deeply. Then then there's a problem before we launch something.  \n* So that's that's Brian's philosophy is that we need to deeply, deeply understand the problem that we're trying to solve before we put it out there. And a B test sometimes  \n* are used as a crux to not know exactly what to do and and to Ab, test a lot of different variations. And so I think it's just a balance, and each company is a little bit different. Our balance is that we are a lot more focused on. We believe we're building the right things. And we are Ab, testing a lot of small things or things that we know would be super impactful for the business. But when we release things  \n* it's released globally to markets and not through an A B test, mostly.  \n* ![John Renaldi][image19]  \n* **John Renaldi**  \n* 02:02:15  \n* You spoke a lot about releasing twice a year and sort of like the bottom lead up to the release, like it's a real case for the company. But you also said, like all people are shipping like we ship 350 updates. So how do you kind of  \n* is a release to you guys when you actually release something to customers. You tell everyone about it. But developers are shipping things all the time.  \n* sort of keeping them high feature. But, like, how do you guys manage that? Think it's really.  \n* ![Kiran Kripakaran][image20]  \n* **Kiran Kripakaran**  \n* 02:02:43  \n* Yeah, no, that's a great question. Yeah. So the we have 2 public releases a year. Where we have a keynote or press release or a video that goes out that Brian speaks about everything that we've delivered. But then we do have, you know, I think, silent releases throughout the year. That aren't as big of a launch or big of an update. Their ab tests, or there's little enhancements that we kind of push out that aren't connected to that release.  \n* I didn't hear you fully, but did that answer the question?  \n* ![John Renaldi][image21]  \n* **John Renaldi**  \n* 02:03:13  \n* Yeah, the question was about, like in the podcast.  \n* It was talking to Brian, one of the 2\\. We're talking about the number like you should be faster.  \n* ![Kiran Kripakaran][image22]  \n* **Kiran Kripakaran**  \n* 02:03:26  \n* Oh, yeah.  \n* ![John Renaldi][image23]  \n* **John Renaldi**  \n* 02:03:27  \n* It said, like 2 releases a year, doesn't necessarily  \n* immediately come to mind how how you're shipping things faster. But it's only 2 times a year. And then he went on to say something like just 350 updates. So obviously, you know, there's not a hundred 50 years or so that passed by so like what- what does he mean by that?  \n* ![Kiran Kripakaran][image24]  \n* **Kiran Kripakaran**  \n* 02:03:47  \n* Yeah, I mean, one part of it is literal, like, you know, these releases are  \n* he? I think we start with what? What is our story to tell for the release. What what are we trying to do to best solve our guest and host problems? That's gonna move the business forward. Once we know what that story is that could that that could be, you know, and most of the times it's like an extra large or large release. That is a significant amount of features. And I think what Brian's trying to say is because the companies in this one roadmap culture  \n* people have the resources and the empowerment, and the you know, the accountability to deliver this for the release. You don't run into a culture where there's pockets of the company still trying to, you know, find resources to do it or whatnot like, if Brian, okay, something for the release, it happens. And even if it's a extra large release. It happens he's spoken about this publicly. But this this launch coming up is the biggest launch we've ever done in the history of Airbnb.  \n* and it's it's gonna fundamentally change how Airbnb is like. It's huge and because he commits to the roadmap. He commits to the resources budget  \n* and support and gives you the accountability because he's asking for it, and he wants to review it, it happens. And so what he's trying to say is, most people think you do. 2 releases a year, you slow down the amount of stuff you can get to the consumer. He's actually saying it's quite the opposite, because I actually make the commitment to do the release and to give the resources to support everything we need to do. It actually happens. And it gets actually shipped to the consumer.  \n* ![John Renaldi][image25]  \n* **John Renaldi**  \n* 02:05:25  \n* You should elaborate on the roadmap meetings that you guys have twice per year, I think, for me like for robust meetings like they- they last more than a few days. There's a big, and for so  \n* for me, having a 90 people or 100 people in a room trying to figure that out. Seems like a lot of work a lot. How you guys  \n* tackle the roadmap with that many people in a room and make decisions. The correct path to go forward.  \n* ![Kiran Kripakaran][image26]  \n* **Kiran Kripakaran**  \n* 02:05:52  \n* Yeah. Actually, one of John's friends, Ravi runs the program organization at Airbnb. It is a highly coordinated machine that ensures that every every. All the trains are moving on time. All the functional trains are moving on time that we're actually supporting what the roadmap we can do. It's a 6 month rolling roadmap that constantly change, you know. It looks out 2 years, but he looks at it every 6 months, and he has these 2 year roadmap reviews to kind of review it with his leadership group. But  \n* the program function, really coordinates that whole calendar and roadmap to ensure that we're doing everything to meet the deadlines. It's it's very. And what's interesting is that program function. Ravi actually reports into the Cfo  \n* Ellie. So he sits in the finance group. And that's because it's about value realization. There are. They are assigned, the the responsibility and accountability to make sure that we're we're actually realizing the value of what we're planning to do for those releases and those launches.  \n* And they sit under the Cfo to make sure that they're able to unlock budget. They're able to unlock resources in partnership with Brian to be able to, you know, actually realize that value. But it's a highly coordinated office. The program function.  \n* is a horizontal, like functional group that sits with all the different functions and make sure that it's a coordinated like machine to get to the release, and they're very sit very closely with Brian, because Brian holds them very accountable to make sure that we actually get there.  \n* ![John Renaldi][image27]  \n* **John Renaldi**  \n* 02:07:21  \n* So to take that a step further. Is it enough to say, like, when you have 70 or 80 people in a meeting  \n* it, it can easily get off the rails pretty fast.  \n* Is there? Just an immense amount of preparation, such that there's a lot of pre reads like there's not a lot of debate. And it's more like.  \n* what's that look like? Because I think, and for anyone here, we just need 89 people meeting. How is that ever successful. So could you give like some, you know, specifics of like, how is, how is that kept on the rails.  \n* ![Kiran Kripakaran][image28]  \n* **Kiran Kripakaran**  \n* 02:07:56  \n* Yeah, these roadmap reviews are.  \n* it's a it's a highly orchestrated event. It's a 1 to 2 day event. It's you know, Brian and Judd. So Judd's my Vp of product.  \n* And then, Hiroki, they coordinate the exact things that they're presenting to the group. So it's almost like a mini keynote internally, where they present you know, and it's a little bit more early in the funnel. So it's not as much like, okay, here's a polish, what it is. It's more like they're presenting. What is the problem they're trying to solve?  \n* How are they gonna solve it? And what could it potentially look like in terms of the app and the design? And it's presented in a way that allows for a little bit of open discussion at the end of those presentations. With with the group. But I think you know, what's really interesting is  \n* because we're so built into this functional model and built into this one roadmap culture.  \n* usually, as roadmap reviews. No one disagrees with an idea because it's already something people have been bought into. We already know it's it's not a surprise per se. It's really about making sure the whole company is is seeing  \n* the work on what's to come for the next release and the subsequent release in in like unison. So that, you know, marketing is like, Oh, you know, we should really consider this to be more of the lead story for the launch versus this one or somebody else being like, Hey, we're also building something. Similarly for this other part of the release that we should probably share like.  \n* So one is kept on rails because a lot of people already know what's to come or kind of understand. It just gives them more clarity, and it actually gives them a moment to cross, pollinate with the with the different functions and the different groups. The second piece of it is, it's you know, it's a coordinated event where it's not just like, Hey, a roadmap on the slide. And then everyone looks at little dots, like people are actually taking the time for one to 2 days to go through the ideas, how they're gonna solve it.  \n* having all the functions come up and present  \n* and so, and then Brian really is involved the whole time. He's the one asking questions. He's a little. He's emceeing it here and there. And so he, as a leader, is pulling people in to get the right feedback. And so those robot reviews sounds simple, but it's actually like, almost like a off site on site one to 2 days.  \n* It's a it's a different mentality when you go there. And what you're how you're supposed to help support the the teams. And what we're gonna do to get to that release.  \n* ![John Renaldi][image29]  \n* **John Renaldi**  \n* 02:10:29  \n* Say that the if you had to pick on  \n* major goal of this, is it really just communications like, is it a communication vehicle more than anything else.  \n* ![Kiran Kripakaran][image30]  \n* **Kiran Kripakaran**  \n* 02:10:41  \n* Yeah, I would say, it's a it's a communication. People to keep everybody, you know. In as part of the journey to hopefully bring up any serendipitous ideas that may have not been thought about without that group together. But it's also an opportunity that everyone feels really good about what we're doing for that next release, so that there isn't any hiccups along the way.  \n* ![John Renaldi][image31]  \n* **John Renaldi**  \n* 02:11:07  \n* As always. Thank you so much for your time. Super valuable, and can't wait to to hear from Robbie  \n* all this 80 to 90 person meeting all.  \n* How many props for that.  \n* ![Kiran Kripakaran][image32]  \n* **Kiran Kripakaran**  \n* 02:11:23  \n* Yeah, yeah, for sure. For sure.  \n* ![John Renaldi][image33]  \n* **John Renaldi**  \n* 02:11:28  \n* Okay.  \n* the last one's pretty short. So let's give you guys 10 min to come back. Let's say at 5\\. After 11\\.  \n* Yeah.  \n* Yeah.  \n* Take a seat.  \n* Alright super interesting conversation with Kieran. Couple of my reflections. I wanna sort of get your thoughts on heard a lot about. Brian believes in it the focus on what Brian wants. I didn't hear as much about what the user wanted. But you know, I know a little bit of that answer which is a lot of that comes from the insights from their research team.  \n* and Brian has a very strong point of view based on those insights from users. But he very much is the, I think, quote unquote editor in chief slash taste maker and you know certainly it seems to work for Airbnb. There's a lot of benefits. What are some pros with this structure that kind of you took away?  \n* What are some of the things that stood out.  \n* You're good.  \n* clear direction totally. I mean, it's very similar to Apple. I don't know if anyone's worked at Apple, but this is very, very close to how apple does things.  \n* But yes, it brings in amazing focus and alignment. I will say that there's a lot of companies. I've been a part of where there's a lot of time.  \n* did I say? Wasted time spent on debating on the why  \n* right? So the certainly from an efficiency perspective. If you have one person that can answer that question and have everyone else focus, I think that got to the point of Hiroki talking about how they're able to ship faster because it's less time spent on the debate  \n* aspect which  \n* listen, that's that's a. It's a time suck in certain organizations. So that's that's a benefit. That's a that's a pro. What else? What's what else stood up  \n* most years like events to Brian is pretty hands on right? Yeah, very hands on. And  \n* in my experience, the the shorter you have, the original founder of the business hands on the better it is for the business. Yeah, right  \n* in our company.  \n* The owner was owning it. That was the best. Yep.  \n* yeah, yeah. There's something about a founder driven culture, very motivating he's in it. You know he cares deeply.  \n* forces others to work pretty hard.  \n* But you know what I found is like, the amount of work isn't the problem. It's the type of work. So if it's really, really rewarding work that's focused on like you feel productive. And you're not spending time just treading water.  \n* you know. Oftentimes people don't mind that type of work. It's the I'm doing a lot of work just to move an inch  \n* is the stuff that drives people bonkers. That I've seen Rishi, I mean. So if executed right, there's a lot of efficiency with how the how the org as a whole is running, because even thinking about like the 350 updates, it's a lot of updates. Yeah, yeah, and so  \n* there clearly is that philosophy and that culture that is embedded into it. And it's also not just by leading by example, but also being able to get others to start thinking like that as well. So  \n* tomorrow he's not there.  \n* He is sort of like securing this ideology that will will remain in the company because of  \n* just constantly being just needs to have someone as the tastemaker. Yeah, that's the thing. With that culture. It's built to have a tastemaker. If all of a sudden someone comes in is no longer that tastemaker. That's where the structure starts to fall apart. Right? So he better have a really good succession plan.  \n* It's probably that Hiroki Guy, as my guess, but, like you better have a 3, 2, or 3, 4 of them right? And so that definitely makes some business continuity questions come into to mind. Yeah.  \n* it's very clear direction. But before they released  \n* to to the mass of the posteri they pre-release the feature. So superposit can offer feedback? Right? Yes, that's right. Yeah, you know. And that's why I asked him the question like, what was the what was actually the point of the 80 or 90 person meeting.  \n* The point actually is to communicate. It's to get it to bring everyone home.  \n* There was a question around change management last week. How do we think about change management? Right? Like you brought this up?  \n* This is his way of change management. He's bringing all the top leaders along for the ride, and if they've missed something that's their time to vocalize it in that meeting. But mostly it's a it's it very much is a 1 to many broadcast versus a let's get in and like whiteboard what the roadmap is. It's like this is the roadmap.  \n* Get on board and let us know if we've missed anything glaring from your research or your insights, but like  \n* it's a communications vehicle, and that's a way for change management. But it also opens up if done in the right way, which I'm assuming it is. I can't wait to talk to my friend Robbie to hear more, but like, if done in the right way does open up for enough feedback for everyone to feel like they put their little thumbprint on it. So it feels like it's part of their work, too.  \n* And so there, if done right, it can be a very effective change management tool. So that doesn't feel so my way or the highway right? I'm just doing what Brian bids like. That's the that's the  \n* that's the fear is like, if it's not done right, it will just feel like, oh, well, this is what Brian wants, right?  \n* One outstanding question I had was around, like, you know, when you have that kind of founder culture which is prevalent through the whole company like, how do you think about incentivizing, incentivize to really be entrepreneurial? Totally. Yeah, it's interesting. I can see lots of pros on that type of structure. I can see lots of challenges with that structure, but always good to bring in different viewpoints  \n* different perspectives, as you think about what works for you, what works for your business, what works for your future businesses? Okay, with that, let's go ahead and get into teams. I want you guys to spend 15 min actually, in about 10 min to share out a little bit, doing a quick exercise on starting some, thinking about the jobs framework  \n* and using. I'll put up that slide again. So you have that reference of thinking about the situation, the motivation, the outcome for your capstones, and then we'll have just a little bit of time to review the assignment for next week, which is very much going a little bit deeper on on jobs to be done for your capstone.  \n* All right.  \n* Want us to know.  \n* Thank you.  \n* Think there's  \n* go straight on  \n* education. Are you aligned with that?  \n* Yeah. What exactly are you trying to do.  \n* He literally was there for 2 months. He gave a bunch of bad advice, and then he transferred to me.  \n* So what are you supposed to do. Are you supposed to pick up one person?  \n* 100 people like when I want to? Yeah, like when I want to.  \n* So I can.  \n* as far as calling in.  \n* Okay, let's go ahead and get together and share out really quick. We've got just a few more minutes left in class, and we still have to review the assignment for next week. So which team wants to kind of share out a few of the jobs that they've identified in our time together  \n* which team wants to share out before I start calling on.  \n* Alright, Josh, so as a small.  \n* When I buy goods from overseas, I want to be able to pay for these goods in a safe way, so that if I don't get the goods I can get my money back  \n* any others that you got besides that one  \n* a little bit of variation on that. But like.  \n* But we have a lot of discussion about what level of abstraction we want to be with these, which is, I think, makes it difficult, but like a high level one would be like when I'm starting my business as a new us immigrant. I want to be able to transact with other businesses, basically, so that I can get my business done. So it's like a much higher level. Yeah, that's why I think it's good to like, have that higher one and then work down. Yep, yep, cool. How about you guys?  \n* When I go to the supermarket. I want to know what to buy and how much to buy, so that I can be more efficient with the meal prep.  \n* When I buy my weekly groceries. I won't be appreciating efficiently.  \n* Use all the producers, so I can reduce the amount of waste.  \n* And  \n* when I see what's the reperto for the app. I want to know what I can cook so I can save.  \n* I'm trying to  \n* alright, trying to plan what to book and what not to book and spend more time.  \n* All right. We don't have time to go through everybody's. Thank you for sharing. Let's quickly highlight the assignment for next week. This is going to be a group assignment. So this doesn't have to be done individually. Just pick one person your team, to submit for the group.  \n* But I do want you guys to interview some users and  \n* given you a Miro link for this. But products looks as a pretty good little thing, so no need to recreate something that's already good. So they've got a nice little tutorial for how to  \n* use jobs to be done in a customer interview format to help you uncover some of those jobs. So it doesn't need to be. You know, you don't need to see discount, just like, find, go online and find, like post  \n* talk to a friend, somebody that sits in a close enough market that you think you'd like to go into, find at least 2 people that you guys can interview using this framework to help you  \n* really come up more with your secret that you guys are trying. So the goal. Here is use jobs to uncover the secret, using the 5 whys really go deeper. Use this framework again. You can find it all in the link. I'll upload these slides, so you'll have that link directly right after class. But this is the assignment for next week  \n* by next week I'll have your 1st week assignments graded.  \n* It's a good question, but you want to see the work across all 6 steps, or just great question. If you could go ahead and  \n* build in this. In this there is like a nice board that they've created to ship them.  \n* Yeah. And in there, like, there's, however, you want to do it bullet sticky notes like whatever. If you want to just  \n* do a printout from Miro and a Pdf. Or send me your Miro link like like.  \n* but that board is is they've got that for you.  \n* Alright\\! Extra credit goes to, if you have, you have more than 2 customers.  \n* but by talking to more users. All right. With that  \n* we've gotten right here at time.  \n* Next week we are meeting on Saturday guest lecturer. I will not be here  \n* I have in the for the past 2 years I've taught this class with my co-teacher, Mike, and Mike is who teaches the business modeling class with me. So he is going to be here teaching next week through tools and behaviors, and our guest speaker will be Matt Menz, Vp. Of Amazon design for aws  \n* and so I will not be here. Mike will but office hours will still be held office hours.  \n* I was wrong that Sunday or Monday, and I put them. I I screwed it up. I made it every 4 weeks. Thank you, Rishi, for calling me out and helping me fix that so it's every week on Mondays for 1 h this week a few of you have come up to me and asked if we could focus a little bit on how to build a gender prototyping into our workflows. So we will use that as our prompt for discussion on Monday evening.  \n* If you have other questions or other things you would like to review.  \n* Come to office hours. We'll go through those first, st  \n* and then we'll move over and spend the rest of our time going through, how you could create a agent prototype  \n* and so with that, have a great weekend. Have a great week next week.  \n* and I will see you again in 2 weeks.",

I gotta say, this is my 3.rd Everyone hear me. Okay, okay, microphone's a little off putting. This is my 3rd year, being a part of Mpd. And   * in my 3 years this is the earliest   * a group of students have ever been in here and seated and ready to go. My expectations are through the roof. Usually I show up at 8, 15, 8, 30, and there's no one in here. There was like 8 or 9 people in here having breakfast.   * Well, they're dialed in. How's everyone doing with the weather?   * Yeah. How many native Chicagoans.   * Okay, so you guys don't care anyone from like California or Florida.   * I'm so like   * curious about this, like you left perfection and weather. I know other things can happen as are well noted to come to this. What a great character building experience for you\\! I'm impressed. It's good. It's good.   * Yeah, of course, that's good. It's good to be out of your comfort zone. It helps every now and again. And then, before we get started, is is this typically here up here? Okay, I was really intrigued like, if this was like a thing we did, we bring people up and put them in the hot seat them with questions.   * Okay, we're not gonna do that. Okay? Well, happy Saturday. It's lovely to be here. My name's Mike Edmonds. I'm gonna spend the 1st couple of minutes introducing myself. Just so you kind of get a feel for who I am. Most importantly, the biases through which I see the world so that you can all come to your own conclusions. As John probably mentioned, I will be teaching with John in the spring   * for business model design. So you will be stuck with me for the spring, but only for one class this this winter quarter.   * So with that, said, I'm going to talk about myself real quick, and then I promise to stop talking about myself. I just want to make sure. You know this is not how I typically roll is just to talk about myself all the time, and then we'll talk about the agenda. So bias number one, the most important job that I have is being a part of my family. I have 3 kids. This is Ben. He is 13 years old, going on 18 years old that is a topic for a different conversation. But let's just say raising an adolescent is a   * and exercise and patience. We had surprise twins 11 years ago. So we had 3 kids under 2, and that's when I decided to start my own company, which I'll tell you all about. But this is my daughter Finley. This is Nick. They're both in 5th grade. My wife Lauren, just started a Fitness studio in Chicago or in Evanston. So now that's kind of a side thing that we're doing. And then this is my amazing dog Pepper.   * which we'll talk all about   * my day job. I work for Microsoft. So I just finished my 3 year anniversary 2 weeks ago. I lead data and AI strategy for our worldwide retail and consumer goods team. So what does that mean?   * Microsoft is a massive company, as we know, there are a few that are bigger to oversimplify. You can think of Microsoft as the business to business side of the house, and then business to consumer. So business to consumer can be things like Xbox surface devices, right? Things that are sold directly to individuals. I'm on the business to business team.   * So in the industry team, we basically work with 250 of the largest retail and consumer goods companies in the world. So think of any brand from Kraft, Heinz to Nike, to Lululemon, everyone in between. And it's my job to lead   * data and AI strategy. So what that means is in this era of co-pilots and agents and generative AI. My job is to inspire these companies to understand art of the possible with what you can do with Microsoft's 1st party products and our partners, and then I work hand in hand with our product teams to influence those roadmaps and to make sure that what they're building meets the needs of enterprise customers.   * I have been teaching at Northwestern, for I just finished my 6th fall this past fall. So through the Triple M program, do we all know what Triple M is? Okay where we love our acronyms. But I started a course called Mindful Product Management 6 falls ago.   * and I have been a part of Mpd, this is my 3rd year, although I'm not teaching this quarter, as you know.   * and I also mentor through Edi.   * So the reason why I mentioned all that is, I love being a part of the Northwestern community. I think I'm the only person who's a part of all 3 of those programs.   * So people like Jim and Greg Holderfield have more than me than they could ever imagine. But the reason why I mentioned it is, it is such a privilege to be here with you today. I obviously have a lot going on with my family love. Every minute that I get to spend with them. I get more energy being a part of this community than you could possibly imagine. So the way that I talk about it like I have friends and family and colleagues who are like, How do you have time to teach on top of a full time job on top of   * supporting your family and all that. And to me it's   * It's kind of funny like I. I treat this as it's all my favorite things about work with none of the political Bs.   * So I get to talk about the things that I love like product and strategy. There's a new cohort of some of the smartest people in the entire world, literally every quarter and I get to learn from you all as much as hopefully. I get to share some things where you get to learn from me. So this is something that I take very, very seriously, and it's honor a privilege to be here, even though it's Saturday morning. This is awesome. So thank you. 1st and foremost.   * okay, my dog, Pepper, do I have any dog lovers in here?   * Okay, I got so much crap in the fall for not bringing my dog into class, which just feels to me like such a liability. She's pepper. She just turned 3 years old. She's a Bernese mountain dog. We got her   * like during Covid   * It was supposed to be something that our kids took care of. And now she's 100% my responsibility.   * but she's amazing. Okay enough about me personally, I'll talk a little bit about my professional background once again, just to give you an understanding of kind of what I'm bringing to the table. So   * the 1st thing to notice here is I started. The the bulk of my career is in professional services. So product management functions in professional services. So what that means is working for companies like Leo, Burnett and Pwc. And razorfish, like we were hired by companies across industries to discover design and scale Digital products and platforms.   * So working with companies like us, foods to launch their b 2 b e-commerce site, working with companies like rider to launch a multi-sided marketplace for sharing brokerage and logistics. The reason why I mentioned that is my product. Lineage comes through the lens of professional services. It's a different type of product like we share the same   * overarching, like between John and myself, like the same lessons, the same ethos, the same philosophy. But it there is a nuance to being like head of product at   * Us. Foods or ahead of product at razorfish like. It's a different spin, and I can talk all about that, if you'd like, but that's something that you all should know. Around 20   * 13,   * actually 2014 into 2015 is when I had the brilliant idea of waiting until I had 3 kids. My wife and I had 3 kids under 2 to say, this is when I want to leave the comfort of razorfish and start my own thing.   * I was not thinking clearly just to put that out there.   * It was a wild time in my life. I remember if anyone has kids here like twins, was a complete disaster. I mean that completely out of love. But like   * I would live my life nap to nap, I would say, if I thought in increments beyond 3 HI would be super overwhelmed, and I remember thinking how quickly life can change. I always wanted to start my own thing. So me and a buddy who worked at razorfish. He was more of a technologist. I was product and growth, started a company called Moonshot Horizon. So it was inspired by books like the lean Startup, the startup way. We wanted to help   * organization better understand emerging technologies, but to do so in a quick and iterative and like minimum, lovable product fashion.   * In 2 years, much earlier than I ever imagined, we got acquired by a company in Beijing, based in Beijing, called Pactera and I ended up sticking around for the next 4 and a half 5 years as chief product officer, then Chief Experience officer, basically running our North America team. That was an agency in New York, product people, designers and data scientists. Chicago, and then we had a few people in Seattle as well.   * Like. I mentioned   * love being a part of Northwestern the connection between Moonshot and Northwestern was one of the pivots that we made early on in our journey at Moonshot. Was that a lot of companies were looking for help like like, I said, discovering designing and building products. But what they really were looking for is the confidence and the skills to do that on their own.   * They didn't understand, at least back then, I think it's still true. Now, like how to how to properly do design thinking how to integrate design, thinking with agile, how do you actually create product cultures where these ideas are kind of taking shape all the time? And you're not kind of paying people outside to do it for you. So when we came to that conclusion, I started to build a training curriculum for our customers at the same time that I was asked to help   * with Northwestern.   * So to me it was an awesome way of like creating a curriculum for moonshot, testing it in the classroom, taking the thing that I was learning in the classroom, testing it in school, or testing it in work and kind of having those, both those things kind of feed each other.   * And then, lastly, in 2022, 2023, I joined something called the Autism Impact Fund   * which is a venture capital outfit, who   * is taking a Vc approach to helping address challenges and problems on the neurodiversity spectrum. So both families and individuals who are dealing with autism, which is an incredibly like my heart breaks thinking about how challenging that is. But this is a group of people who want to fix that. And my job as an advisory board member is basically to vet investments that are technology related. And then I do support operating companies with how they scale.   * Okay, that's a lot of words.   * These words make sense any questions.   * Okay.   * okay, let's talk about in my current role. One of the products that I'm a part of just once again to give you a flavor for the kind of things that I'm doing on a day to day.   * So, as our industry team, like I mentioned retail and consumer goods. Microsoft has a thing called cloud for retail, which is basically the way that we position azure which is Microsoft's Cloud to meet the outcomes and business objectives of retailers who use it. So think of this as like, it's a storytelling narrative. 1st and foremost, it's how we contextualize our products to make sense for retailers. But then we also make investments into specific use cases that we think are broadly applicable to the industry at large.   * One of those is   * so are, are we? Have we talked about agents in class?   * I think John's mentioned that. Okay.   * agents, agents, agents, it's the new buzzword. We're gonna talk a little bit about them today. But what I want to ship here is a product that I led strategy on and not leading. Go to market. Currently I'll let you kind of look at it real quick. It's just like a 2 min video.   * You get to hear me stop talking for a minute.   * AI is revolutionizing the shopping experience.   * Microsoft Cloud for retail offers, a personalized shopping agent to provide a more intuitive, personalized, and enjoyable retail experience. All on the retailer's existing technology platforms. Dan, who has never left the city, receives an invitation from his adventurous friends to join them on a camping trip, intrigued but unprepared. He visits adventureworks to buy the gear he needs to survive in the wild. He opens the chat and describes what he's looking for.   * The personalized shopping agent guides him through the process, recommending products that are perfect for the location and time of year. Turning his novice confusion into excitement. Dan can ask for alternatives and get suggestions, making the process easy and convenient.   * The personalized shopping agent can also recommend related items to increase basket size as well as customer satisfaction.   * The personalized shopping agent is grounded in your brand and retail data to provide personalized suggestions, to improve customer satisfaction.   * unlock the full potential of your business, and embrace the future with Microsoft Cloud for retail.   * Alright.   * Okay? So basically, in case that wasn't abundantly clear, we've packaged up our co-pilot stack, which is azure open AI, we've integrated it into a retailer's 1st party data to think like products pricing inventory and promotions. And we make it. We package it up and offer it to retailers, to basically reimagine how people shop online. So that's a new thing that we just launched last year. Currently landing customers.   * I'll talk more about it as we get into today. But just to give you an example of spattering of some of the companies that I worked with, both in consulting, and personally   * you can kind of see here. I don't need to drain this too much   * one thing as well. I believe that one of the aspects of modern product people that is severely underlooked is it's kind of the way this program is developed. It's what I teach in Triple M is this concept of both sides of your brain?   * I think, unfortunately, a lot of what product, when you walk into organizations and kind of assess what their product culture looks like it's over indexing on what we call delivery. So it's people who are lean enthusiasts you see, agile through and throughout. If people ever read the books by Marty Kagan.   * inspired, empowered.   * Does this book ring a bell? Okay. He makes the difference between a feature team and an empowered team   * where a feature team is basically handed by a different function, a list of features or a vision or a plan. And it's the products team to go execute.   * So the challenge with this is that in that org and those orgs can still be wildly successful. But in those orgs these product people are not interacting with customers on a day by day, hour by hour, basis. And I see that as a big problem, so we try to teach is like, look, this is the foundation of product you have to be able to execute. Execution is, or our mode is, our rate of execution. But we also have to combine it with problem, discovery and problem finding.   * So I believe, this wholeheartedly. And you'll hear this come out throughout today as well as in the spring. John's talked about this before, right? He has another one around minimum generative   * products. I think. Okay, I believe this is in in my core, which is   * our job as product people is to evoke emotions   * at the end of the day is to create products that are that improve humanity, that are human, centered in nature, and that clearly address specific emotions that we want to evoke. So I don't think we need to be doing what's feasible and what's possible. And that's the most important thing it really is. What can move the needle from an emotional from an experience standpoint?   * you'll have this as a backup, I promise. This is a slide. One of, I think, one more left after this. People always ask like books that I'm inspired by. So you'll have this. You can look at it but 2 that I want to draw attention to right away. Has anyone read Cointelligence by Ethan Malik? Okay, you should follow him on Linkedin. If you are interested in AI and the evolution of Product. A very fascinating read. And then the anxious generation.   * This rings a bell. Okay. My class in the fall is like centered around this. So it's something that I'm super passionate about.   * Okay. And then last, but not least. I like I mentioned. Let's begin or end kind of where we began. Super. Proud to be a part of this community. I believe wholeheartedly that your network is your net worth every job partnership. You know, major thing that I've ever received in my career has been through people doing acts of kindness. So if I can be of any value to you as you're in school thinking about what happens after school, even many years down the road, like proud to be a part of the same community. So   * okay, that's as much as I'm gonna talk about myself.   * Let's talk about today. So we're going to do a quick hitter on current events, I always start class with, just like, kind of acknowledging what's happening outside of the 4 walls here, and to try to draw parallels into what we're talking about today. We're going to quickly hit on where we left off last week. But then the purpose of today is innovation through the lens of enterprises. By show of hands. How many people currently work for startups   * or have aspirations to work in startups? How about that?   * Okay? And how many people after school will go into enterprise.   * Okay, what are the rest of you gonna do consulting? Got it? Okay.   * we'll see, was one answer, price enterprise. Okay, okay? Good. Good.   * Okay. We have a guest speaker today. Matt Menz, who's the Vp of design at Aws fascinating guy. He'll be here from 10 to 11\\. We'll take a break around 11\\. We'll use the next chunk in an activity the way that we typically plan out. I think John mentioned this before. It's like 1 h lecture, 1 3rd lecture, 1 3rd visitor, 1 3rd interactive.   * We'll wrap things up and then talk about the assignment for next week. Is there anything here that's missing that you were expecting to see? That's not here   * on a scale of one to 10? How excited are you to embark on this journey today.   * 12\\. That's what I heard. Okay, great love it.   * Okay, let's do it. So a couple of current events.   * how many people noticed what Openai released this week with operator.   * Okay, does anyone here pay for chat? Gpt, pro.   * okay. Has anyone had a chance to check it out yet, does anyone have access?   * Okay? So we've heard about it. But no one's actually used it   * fair. Okay, for those of you who maybe you have not heard about it. Let's talk about it real quick. So operator is. You can read it here. It's a research preview of an agent that can use its own browser to perform tasks for you. So what does this actually mean? Let's check it out   * so you can see here it's access through chat gpt, and you can say things like, Find me   * a friendly campsite to Joshua Tree this weekend. And right now, since it's in research Preview, there's only a handful of sites that it works with, but basically it, this agent will pull up a browsing experience. You can have your hands off your keyboard just kind of text it if you want to, you'll eventually be able to use voice. But it'll run through not only like finding   * places for you to go to it'll actually book it for you, and then ask you questions along the left, along the left hand side for you to keep the human in the loop for you to interact with it if you need to. In case that was a little bit esoteric. Let's look at this is a 2 min video of a product person that I follow, who talks about her experience with it. Just to give you a little bit of kind of background for what this looks like.   * So that's the 1st time I'm trying it. So you can see here it has different verticals, like dining and events and delivery, and for each one of them you can see which services they're affiliated with, like uber eats and instacart for delivery local services. Oh, Thumbtack, that's nice in case I want to fix something shopping travel. So let's say, I want to do dining. They're affiliated with open table.   * Oh, or you can book a concert. That's great, because I've been doing so much research on Coldplay tickets. Okay, let's see. Book a table for 2 for Valentine's Day since it's coming up at one of my favorite restaurants, da Verna   * and Palo Alto. Alright. Let's see what happens.   * Oh, that's nice. So there is a browser and operator browser, and you can see it's gonna search for taverda in Palo Alto.   * and it finds the restaurant I'm looking for.   * It looks like it's a bit slower than I would expect.   * but the fact that you can take control is amazing, because it still does the groundwork for you like searching for the restaurant and all these things. So now it's asking me.   * there is. There are variable slots. Yep, yes, book it.   * I like that. It asks for a lot of confirmation. Basically, it's it's it can see, the agent can see what you're browsing. It can answer questions for you, but then also take action, which is the main difference between like a co-pilot and an agent. An agent is an autonomous bit of AI that can complete tasks on your behalf, either riding shotgun with you or for you   * the 1st company that I've seen who's publicly talking about it is Instacart. So since I don't have access to it, I'm not paying for the pro version because I have to pay for other Microsoft stuff. This is a really interesting example. Where Instacart talks about the way that you can leverage an agent to shop so you could be like, I'm hosting a dinner for 12 people. We want to have an Italian meal. What should we get   * right, and what it'll do is look at all the different, you know, products and ingredients maybe share a couple of recipes with you, turn those recipes into products, products, into your cart cart, into checkout checkout into your front door, and that can all happen via an agent. So right now, what's interesting to notice that like, there's this really cool experience that Marily just shared around like this kind of pulls the browser in keeps you in the loop.   * I'm pontificating very easy to see how like you don't even really need this at the moment like this is more like showing you how it's doing. But it's very easy to think how that could just occur kind of behind the scenes.   * I want to share this 1st of all, just to kind of open it up and get your perspective. What do you? What do you think about this? What do you think about agents in terms of shopping or agents in terms of changing the way that we work. When you think about the lens of like enterprise, innovation, I'd love to hear just initial reactions, thoughts, questions, concerns.   * Yes.   * I personally hate grocery shopping so much so. This is the only so far. That's the main one that's been like. Oh, that would actually save so much time if I would just say, Hey, with this recipe, if you break this down for me and actually figure it out, that'd be perfect like I don't want to know what half the item is. A very helpful at 1st I was like booking. A reservation takes 2 seconds to be that hard, but   * starting with simple use cases, and we'll evolve into difficult ones. I, too, share a distaste for grocery shopping. So we have that in common. Yes, of like fruits or produce or anything like I would want to see it rather than someone just picking it out for me. Yeah, that's the biggest reason why in our family. We don't often online grocery shop. My wife has a problem with that. Thank you for sure. Yeah. Yes. Behind you.   * just a concern like when they're launching like, since they are using their own web browser they have mentioned like they're bypassing a lot of captures. So does that create like security issues   * it could, it certainly could. I'm gonna share a couple of things I have to say right off the bat. That are not of.   * although I work for Microsoft like I'm not speaking for Microsoft. I have my Northwestern hat on, so I just want to say that like Don't go tweeting what I'm saying in here. It's even still called Tweeting. I don't know. But yeah. So like what's interesting about our partnership with   * open AI is that we're both partners and competitors   * like we partner. Because Microsoft leverages all of Openai's models on azure, which is why we have the lead that we do.   * We also have, you know, over 1,800 other frontier and open source models that we host. But this is clearly the biggest game in town, but they're also a competitor. So we will be working with customers like Instacart, for instance, where they will have to choose to work with Microsoft or Openai, one of our biggest   * value propositions when we're in those kind of conversations is security. Is that Microsoft? Although Openai, if you work with Openai, it'll run on azure when you're working directly with azure. Openai and Microsoft like. It's backed by the best security risk compliance and protocols in the entire world. So that's the thing like I'm sure they have that figured out with security. But I would argue that Microsoft has, like a much more sophisticated posture when it comes to that.   * Yeah, copilot uses Openai models.   * So it's taking. Yeah. So chat Gpt or so, copilot will leverage the latest and greatest models from Openai   * think it's also interesting, like with this operator? Is it like navigating?   * Have, like a version optimized? Or   * so you bring up really good question. So like   * I, I, too, when I look at this, I'm like, cool. But like, is it really solving a real problem? For real people   * always consider the worst AI we're ever going to use is the AI today.   * how much better it'll be in the future. So when you think about like, is it easier? Does it take long? Yeah, I think today you're probably right? I would ask the question, which is, what's the future of websites going to be? And if we have agents or personalized interactions that can basically navigate and traverse websites at the end of the day, especially in e-commerce, are just a digital manifestation of the way that products exist in a warehouse   * like I have to traverse through a catalog of like Macro down to micro find the thing that I want. Keyword search helps, but it's not super helpful, because I have to know the product that I'm looking for, and the way to talk about it in a Brand's language. If you can have an agent who's doing these things for you, I would argue like, does the design of websites really become what's the most efficient way for agents to complete tasks on our site   * we shall see. Yes.   * So because our capstone project is also based on agent for retail cool, we should talk.   * integrating all these goods.   * It was interesting to see like, did this develop a new feature for browsers, or even   * just to add like, why, they're not using Apis rather than using the browser interface to communicate like isn't Apis much faster to do the same process?   * Can you ask the question again?   * Like, aren't Apis more faster to execute such tasks as operators are existing like, yeah. So keep in mind that think of like operator and even chat gpt, although it's a product that they offer. It's really a demonstration of what's possible, like   * the the business of Openai is an Api game   * where they're gonna open up these to do any brand can do like you could have your own operator that looks and feels and sounds like Instacart versus one. That sounds like expedia. Right? Yeah, Vanessa.   * this is just with the Ui to get the general general consumers, and understanding help visualize like, what is the agent? It does seem so abstract like. This is just a nice way for the general public to understand what's actually happening.   * It's always kind of advanced beyond an interface for this.   * that they have the ability to.   * And do you think that that ui is unique enough to   * the the ui itself. I don't know.   * I have not thought about that.   * I think ui and agent agents are changing our common grasp of what user experience looks like. I think that's gonna be a standard in a paradigm. I don't know that it's patentable. But yeah, I'd be curious to learn how that unfolds. Yeah, maybe a couple more up front.   * Excuse me.   * Oh, yeah.   * all the poor advertisers do.   * Yeah. So we'll talk in our business model class. We'll talk about the the business models of web 2.0 or 3.0. And what those are gonna look like in our current era. I sincerely hope   * that we will not slap advertising the way that we did in like the era of social media under the era of Agentic AI. Because I think that has had catastrophic, unintended consequences. I think ads will play a role, but it's going to look and feel a lot different like. Now, we're providing answers like, not a list of things to consider. Let's do 2 more. Yeah, appreciate.   * I think the the operator is an example. And I'm kind of being optimist about this like disclaimer. But   * it shows a very foundational view of what is human plus AI, the human plus AI equation looks like, because even in this yes, the AI agent is doing the work. But you still have the option of opting in and taking over. Now, I think this setting a certain foundation is to really understand   * what types of jobs that people want   * system to take over, to reduce their cognitive load and focus on other things, and where they want to be a little bit more cognizant. I think that I think one of the things that a chat Gpt could explore, and openly I could explore is.   * is it?   * Can they   * operate and observe the patterns and preferences of users to make the agent even more efficient. That's a question. It also opens up to grounds to regulation and privacy. So there's a lot of these open and open, ended questions to explore. But in a very simple form, like.   * it's not all AI. It is human plus AI at the end of the day totally. And I so I appreciate that as well. I am about as optimistic as they come   * once again. That's a bias to share. I'm not saying you all should be optimists, but you need to know that. That's the way that I'm talking about it.   * however, things are fundamentally changing. Yeah, right? And I think there's a lot of uncertainty there, let's go one in the back who's been waiting very patiently. So I work in a medical device in this industry. So it's heavily regulated and we are under audit multiple times a year. And when we have an audit   * we have an entire team dedicated to responses, to the audit, to the auditor. So this is exactly what I imagine like, if we can have an enterprise version of this to navigate our internal systems, to be able to like succinctly and efficiently deliver a response to like to the auditor. I I wonder what this is going to look like in the enterprise setting   * totally, I think these have   * Agentic AI has the most legs, at least over the near term in enterprise scenarios, for sure, like in our in my industry, there's so much resistance to change because it is so heavily regulated. And we're also dealing with like internal, like intellectual property as well as oftentimes like patient results so like, I don't know how to balance that. Or do you have any thoughts on that?   * How to balance results with what like patient results and intellectual property and proprietary documents. Yeah, yeah, we should. We should catch up on that. I mean, that's a that's a highly nuanced one specific to your industry. Yeah.   * Yeah. Last one   * think the difference between this and the stuff is like, they're deliberately limiting this to like 10 websites where, yeah, you could build   * things for that. But like this, technology would work on any website, you go to any random website. And the AI could book the whole thing and do whatever. So like, I think it's got way more potential than   * what you can do with Apis and things like, yeah, I think that would that would work today. I think it's just you gotta talk to Microsoft at the end of the day. This is still a pro. I still see it as a prototype. Even. What's funny is that even Gemini has an AI agent that not many people know about. But it's purely for research basis. It's not perfect. But   * the idea is. Again, it's performing this user task. And they're all prototyping. And they're all trying to really understand is like, what is the what is the core problem that I can solve with an agent like, what? What are the problem that exist today at a mass scale or users? And then software? So it's it's a fact like I see this very foundational in the next minute. Here, I want to share   * maybe one more version of this, and then we'll move on with the day. Does anyone here use copilot?   * Okay, you're not gonna hurt my feelings. It's not my product. I'm not gonna tell you. Yes, okay, so what I'm going to share. Here is a version of what we just saw. The the operator is taking actions for you, but I want to share this one. This concept of multimodal, which is basically that large language models can receive input not only in texts, but also can see   * and then can share images and videos out the other end. So this is an example of voice voice to voice, and it can see what's happening on my browser. Now, I have not tested this in this room. So if it doesn't work, please don't blame me.   * Good morning, Michael. I was just thinking of you. What's going on?   * Hi copilot can you tell me what's showing on this web page?   * Hey, Michael, from your screen? It looks like you're on wayfair scoping out furniture deals the main parts, highlighting some accent chairs and living room pics plus some other sec. Can you help me find a couch   * or a sofa?   * I see a keep shopping for sofas section towards the left of the image, showcasing various sofas. Check that out for any couches.   * Okay, awesome. I don't have time to read all these reviews. Can you summarize both the the best review and the worst review for me   * most of the reviews are positive. Praising the sofa for its quality, comfort, and stylish design. The worst reviews mention issues with delivery or assembly, but it seems like these are more about logistics than the product itself overall. It's well liked for its sleek leather finish and comfortable seating. If you want to find a comfortable and stylish sofa, this one might suit you   * absolutely to save it to your cart. Select the add to cart button near the it can't take action yet. It's a big thing. Okay?   * okay, that's a quick, quick hitter on current events. Agents, we're going to talk about not only today.   * but we'll also come through, I think, through some of your capstones as well as what's going to be going on in the spring. So okay, real quickly, before we take new ground, I want to quickly hit on where we left last week. So   * lior came in from Uber freight, right?   * That was 2 weeks ago. Okay, awesome. And what an incredible guy. Hopefully, you all took a lot from this conversation, I think   * what I love about leor visiting all the time is his concept of like the stepping stone of innovation like they started with, like, you know, once, like driverless trucks right? And then went into a software business, then turned into like, go into a cloud company beyond. Just kind of sharing capacity. He is absolutely brilliant. I understand we've talked about a comprehensive approach to leadership and innovation   * all the things here we talk a lot about culture. Well, today we'll talk a bit more about culture, a little bit on talent, some on tools. We've talked about Keeley's 10 types of innovation. Have you all turned in a paper around this?   * Okay? Awesome and then.   * lastly, you talked about jobs to be done. Was there a jobs to be done, assignment that you had to do as well? Or was it an activity in class?   * Okay, okay, how do we feel about that assignment was this concept, make sense. Okay, anything like tough to tough tough to grasp? Or do we feel good about   * cool?   * Okay, I take that as like, a yeah. Kinda   * okay. Great. Any questions about where we've been?   * Are you ready to move forward?   * Okay, forward. Let's do it all right. Okay. One thing real quick, Brittany.   * Could you do me a favor? And when Matt shows up, just let me know it should be at 10 o'clock. But I'm not going to see it, especially if I'm   * yeah. Okay. Okay, so let's talk about innovation tools and processes for enterprises. What we're gonna do is hopefully finish this in the next 20 min Matt will come. Then we'll take a break. Okay? So 1st things first, st   * innovation by stage of the company is fundamentally different at each. At each stage. What I loved about lior is like, put this into perspective for lior, like when he started his company as a startup. It's all about survival, right? It's about.   * how can you as quickly and efficiently as possible, establish product market fit? The Pm role is typically very general. It could be the founder, the CEO, the Coo. They have a very broad remit. It's basically get whatever you can get done in order to survive. As a company.   * Nothing matters until you ship a product that meets the real problem for real people as you go into growth stage, this is about scale. So you've identified that initial fit. You have business model fit. You have people problem fit. Now, this is about scaling it to adjacent markets and globally to make more money. It's about replicating what you know will work   * as quickly as possible. Enterprise companies have already achieved some level of fit. And now we're in the challenge of, how do we execute the current business model while also exploiting and extending to net new business models?   * Okay, we're going to talk a lot about this today. But you can see how the role of Pm. Is different, and a lot of time that I've spent both starting my own thing. But then spending a lot of time with enterprises we get stuck in. That loop of execution is all that matters. We find ourselves sprinting in various directions, and we don't know that we've landed at the wrong destination until we've gotten there. Okay, that's we're kind of   * snapping on problem discovery design thinking alongside execution is a pivotal   * skill set for the modern product person.   * So I want to pull the audience here. What? When I say innovation within an enterprise, what do you think that means   * what's the 1st thing that comes to mind?   * What? What does it mean to innovate in the big company? Yeah, new feature and updates love it. Thank you.   * Anyone else. Yes, you can just shout it out. Yeah, small innovation, new business model innovation. Okay? Great. So new ways to make money on current products, new products, new partnerships. Okay, love it. Not just about tech. It's about business model product services. Love it in the back. Okay.   * love it. New technology like right now, everyone's asking about AI   * gentic AI. How can I do that to reimagine customer, partner, stakeholder, employee experiences   * definitely innovative. Yep, product parity with competitors to see what everyone else is doing and copy. Yeah.   * that's 1 strategy parody.   * Leapfrogging is another. But those are both do something actually crazy. Actually.   * okay and do something batshit crazy.   * Okay, describe what batshit crazy means. Well,   * it's it's never. It's never thought it was deemed to be possible. And then you make the impossible possible. There you go. So like moonshots. Oh, more like moon shots. Yeah, there, you goonshots perfect. I would prefer batshit crazy instead. That's better. Yeah. So when you say enterprise? Yeah.   * So if if it is that, then I think that enterprise become a bit more conservative and looking more into internal, like processes and organization innovations, how to make things more efficient rather than and how- how to get a bit more money and people margins out of what has already been launched coming up with   * breakthroughs. Yes.   * beautiful, beautiful point. So I'm going to paraphrase in enterprises. Innovation can often be exploiting the current business model and finding more efficient ways to get done. What you know is working. Okay? Totally agree.   * Yes, one more. Yeah. There's a spectrum of existing products and existing markets, and then thinking about like, how do you take existing products to adjacent markets or new markets? How do you work with new markets and have adjacent products or new products love that   * you have a question.   * I can make a comment. So if we think about the profit, the innovation essentially allows the company to stay   * offering margins. Yep, totally   * okay. Good. I like that. Okay, has anyone worked in large organizations where you've been a part of things like incubators   * or outposts or hackathons.   * Did these ring a bell? Okay, I was a part of a thing called the Innovation Outpost. Early on in my career. I thought it was so cool. And then I wondered why all the cool things we came up with. No one really wanted to help build and scale, because technically, what you often see is that   * if you call one group an innovation outpost, or an incubator or an accelerator, it kind of inherently means that the other groups are not innovative.   * right? And there's often like cultural barriers.   * And then oftentimes what comes out the other end of these innovative groups. It's really tough to then feed those and build a bridge back into the enterprise, to then execute and scale. Those are different sides of the brain. So these are different ways to innovate, but they certainly do not guarantee innovation within an enterprise.   * So one definition for enterprise is satisfying users, current or future jobs to be done by turning an idea into a product or service with speed and urgency, with the constraints of the business. Thank you, Steve. Blank.   * Okay.   * these things typically need to be true in order for success to be achieved with innovation in an enterprise. And if you disagree like this is a many to many environment for learning. So if you're like, look.   * I totally disagree that it needs to be measured. I'd love to hear that perspective.   * Okay, there has to be a path to adoption. So not just creating something cool. But how do you? In Microsoft? It's all about scale, all about go to market. So creating one awesome thing in corner could be bright and shiny and interesting, but if there's no path to adopt, it at scale doesn't make sense, it has to fit into the overall mission strategy and purpose of the organization. Right? It can't be completely going a different direction.   * It must be measured because things that get measured, get funded. Most innovation is unfortunately typically supported by annual budgeting cycles.   * not innovation accounting, which we'll talk about in the spring. It's managed as a portfolio which we'll talk about today and then has top down support.   * Try to do something innovative without top down support in an enterprise.   * write a blog about it and share it with me.   * Okay,   * so what are some of the problems that enterprises face like? If it's clear it can be a new feature. It can be a new tech, a new something batshit, crazy, or what like. Why isn't everyone doing it?   * What's happening? And we could spend the rest of the day talking about this. What? Top of mind? Yes, risk assessment, risk, assessment, risk to go into new areas without it being validated correctly. Love it.   * It goes against individual's own interest, oftentimes, because, like.   * like, you know, you get all of the all of the blame if it goes wrong. But you don't actually get to keep much of the work. There we go.   * It's just kind of irrational in a lot of places. Yes, beautiful. The difference between   * artists and soldiers, and how it really comes down to incentives, incentives, incentives, incentives? Yes.   * so enterprises. They have this like as per innovators. Dilemma, for example, right? So they have the established value chains. They just don't know how to create and work in other value chains, and often times of these new innovations. They require like new approaches   * creating the value. And that just isn't happening, because it's so contradicting to the way current enterprise operates. And that's why I think that's 1 of the major problems. The innovators dilemma is fascinating to watch, unfold. Even today, as John talked about his experience with Google   * at all. Okay, he has really good stories to tell about that. Okay, so risk innovators dilemma, which is basically I can't take my eye off what's working the currently cash register of today, because that will risk that. For what could be the cash register of tomorrow? I love it behind you. Yep, a lot of focus on politics. So a lot of times people are reported for being good at politics, innovating and innovation.   * Often that gets to the next level is because it's already adding on to somebody else's idea that's already been existing for a long time.   * So circling back 100 times. Oh, yeah, you're describing Microsoft. Yes, in the back, in the case of publicly traded companies, they're behold the shareholders. Oh, yeah.   * yep.   * behold into the Quarterly the quarterly numbers. So it's really tough to think long term. If you have to show returns every 3 months. Yep.   * yep, yeah, at least not right away. Exactly. Yeah, perfect. Yes.   * yes. Failure to understand the market. The new market and the needs of people, 1,000%. We oftentimes navel gaze in enterprise. We fall in love, the things that we're creating and just assume. People will love them. But it really has to work the other way around. Right? Totally agree? Yeah, maybe a couple more. Yeah, such as   * book describes it. The Moses trap. Yeah. Like, you know. If the leader doesn't get about doesn't believe in your idea, your idea can be scrapped. Yeah, awesome. 1st of all quick pause. I love referencing. The reading is amazing. I got to pat John on the back for his work there. Very, very well done. Yes.   * incentives is the structure of the business, like our company is trying to innovate in new categories in places. But they kind of treating those areas as if they're franchise products. They want them to success like, within one or 2 years, the same thing as   * maybe a hundred years.   * There's a quote, awesome build, Eduardo. There's a quote. I'm blanking on who said it, but it goes something like   * what companies ship is, a reflection of their org structure.   * right? And that's both a good thing and a bad thing.   * Right? But yeah, I completely agree. Let's go one more in the back. Actually, what Jan was saying around regulatory concerns. So like. I work in the space of Jenny and Content, and half the time it's just around bad regulation or bad regulatory agents that don't allow for modular content, or things like, you know, anything new and advancing to come to play, using the same operational matrix for the innovation. Oh, yeah.   * yes, the same metrics. So the same metrics for current business model to loon shots which really comes down to like return on investment. Right? Yeah, yeah, okay, I love it. These are great great builds. I think we kind of did all these. I'm not going to read them all, but I would say one   * that is strategically underlined is that innovation become becomes execution.   * Okay, so this is like, there's a group, an incubator, an outpost, or whoever came up with an amazing idea.   * And then that gains traction. And now it has to basically be handed off from the people who generated the idea to the people who are going to scale it   * right. But oftentimes that's the same team that does it. And the same team that came up with the idea isn't necessarily skilled to execute or to scale on a on a global basis. And that employees or founders typically don't fit within the execution organization. So they leave or jump onto the next cycle of innovation. So the ultimate question we think about innovating and executing exploiting and exploring   * slash extending can companies do both at the same time.   * And this is a rhetorical question. Of course, of course they can. It's called the ambidextrous organization. So does this ring a bell.   * this visual, and anyone gets a bonus point if you know what it is.   * That's it.   * You said, double faced quotes, yeah, Janice, you said, Yana, yeah. Yeah. Janice Giannis, same thing. So it's this ancient Roman civilization. It's basically   * the ability to look at the past and the future at the same time. And I think what's important in in the context of business is being. Janice Face is looking at the current and looking at the future and being able to pedal both sides of that bike with equal levels of urgency. That's what an ambidextrous organization is. So a company that can achieve breakthrough innovations while relentlessly improving the way to execute the current business model. So getting better at what you already know to be true, more efficient, like, Ivan said, but then also serve existing and net new customers.   * Ambidextrous organizations constantly reinvent themselves before they become obsolete.   * They explore the future while exploiting the present I love. I love that terminology.   * There. It is a an organization where the culture.   * both of these different cultures, the innovation, culture, and the exploitation, or the ex or the execution culture can live in harmony under the same roof, very, very challenging to do, and then   * the last one around business models. So   * this company, or this book called the Invincible Company by a company called Strategizer is incredible. If you're interested in this, I recommend all of the books that they've created business, model design business model generation and the invincible company are incredible. But it talks about how, on the spectrum of exploring, where there's high uncertainty and exploiting, which is low uncertainty and kind of   * defines in detail what this ambidextrous organization looks like. So we talk about culture. So an exploration. Culture cultivates creativity, discovery and validation and acceleration of completely new ideas foreign to an organization. These are the people who are looking downfield   * right, who are looking beyond the confines of the of the constraints of the business of the current state business model and are thinking what's new and what's next? Whereas the exploitation culture cherishes the management, the systemic improvement of getting better at what we do now. How do we do it? Cheaper, faster, with less resources, squeezing out cost, protecting our margins, etc, etc.   * We talk about. There's different levers that describe how these cultures interact from certainty to focus   * where on the exploit side, it's efficiency and growth on the explore side. It's search and breakthrough we mentioned here on the different operational metrics. So financial philosophy, when it comes to exploiting, it's all about returns and dividends, return on investment, return on investment, return on investment and the explore side. It feels more like venture capital. Has anyone read the book called The Lean Startup, or the startup way by Eric Reese.   * Okay, the whole chapter dedicated something called innovation accounting, which is basically how large enterprises can adopt the funding model that's been popularized by Vc. Into a corporate culture, and how you basically fund new ideas and sleeves   * like shorter, more smaller, more incremental sleeves, where, if people come back with early indications of success. You kind of release more sleeves as time goes on. In my limited experience this is the number one thing that holds companies back from a corporation perspective is, how do you fund differently?   * Okay. Then you can read the other ones. I don't want to read these all to you. Okay. Who can think of? I have a pet peeve of just reading slides. I know I do it sometimes, but I'm not going to do it all the time. You can think of a couple of companies who exist today who are ambidextrous.   * Okay, say more.   * Oh, they started the search engine, and now they're into they, I mean, they. Essentially.   * I have been innovating and how to organize the world's information, but also been doing other things on the side. For example, Waymo, like driverless cars.   * They also had Project Loon at some point, so they I would say they're not as ambiditious as they were before, but an example of how they've been focusing on on the current execution, but also exploring. Yes, completely. I agree. I will do my best not to bash competitors of Microsoft.   * Although Google isn't a fantastically amazing company, they are one of the, if not the best, example of ambidextrous. They're also, unfortunately, a great example of the innovators. Dilemma, but awesome one. Okay, Google, what else?   * Pepsico Pepsico that really focuses on growing their core business. So Quaker Frito lay really growing that. But they have a huge design and innovation focus in terms of, you know, creating and incubating new products in house. They used to have a lot of agency reliance. I used to work for one of the agencies that was part of that, and then they brought in everything in house, and so they do all the incubation in house and new customers.   * You know all that creation in house, and they do acquisitions, and so much of their acquisitions in the last 5 years have been targeted around new health trends and basically people moving away from sugar and finding ways to complete their portfolio by, you know, focusing on new emerging. Okay, love it, Pepsico. Does anyone remember clear Pepsi?   * Maybe that's not an innovation. I don't know what is okay. Anyway, I love the non-tech example, too, we fall in love with Tech over here. Yes, in the back. Okay. Northrop, Grumman, okay, do a really good job of separating their product portfolio. So they have more established product lines, and they have other product lines, and they have separate divisions that work on.   * So there's a lot of communication that we said the you know executive higher management level and how to share resources between those. Okay. Love it. Awesome example. It's a fantastic company, too.   * I mean, if you think about like, they've essentially have taken the concept of fast food restaurant, have elevated that level. They've also found ways to   * off essentially streamline the fast food experience like, how can we make it more faster   * and and more efficient for people to come in and come out? I think they basically have kind of predominantly done a pretty good job of this. And they aren't. They're testing. They're always iterating on recipes. They're always testing and learning in the kind of foods and services they want to offer. And yeah, I would say, they're fairly ambroduction as well. Can you think of like a net new   * like. Be like exploring new business model that Mcdonald's has done. I'm not disagreeing. I'm just curious like I can't think of one that's like totally the cosmics. Oh, yeah, there you go, love that. Yes, something entirely new. It's not typical, typical to their core   * business model or to their courser product offering. But it's something different. And they are again it they're testing and the prototyping and the learning to see what's working. What's not working, Justin? Were you gonna build on that?   * Yeah.   * yeah, you could call that in many ways like, that's their core business. Have you seen the movie founder? Yeah, yeah, it's brutal, absolutely brutal. Brittany. Okay. Okay. Awesome. We will continue this. After our   * visitor.   * And Matt, can you hear us? Okay.   * cool.   * ![Mike Edmonds][image2]   * **Mike Edmonds**   * 01:01:04   * Fair enough.   * ![Ford ITW 1.350][image3]   * **Ford ITW 1.350**   * 01:01:05   * Matt, can you hear us? Okay.   * awesome.   * It's okay.   * Let's see.   * We'll get going here in just 1 min.   * It's changed it.   * hey, Matt, can you hear us in the room.   * ![Matthew Menz][image4]   * **Matthew Menz**   * 01:01:54   * Yeah, I've got you just getting.   * ![Ford ITW 1.350][image5]   * **Ford ITW 1.350**   * 01:01:55   * Hey\\!   * ![Matthew Menz][image6]   * **Matthew Menz**   * 01:01:56   * Just getting goody set up how you all done.   * ![Ford ITW 1.350][image7]   * **Ford ITW 1.350**   * 01:01:58   * Beautiful, awesome. We're doing really well. Happy Saturday morning.   * ![Matthew Menz][image8]   * **Matthew Menz**   * 01:02:03   * Yeah, right? It's here.   * ![Ford ITW 1.350][image9]   * **Ford ITW 1.350**   * 01:02:05   * Yeah. So, Matt, you're based in San Francisco. Right?   * Yeah. Yep, you're not. You're not enjoying this amazing weather we have in Evanston. Which is.   * ![Matthew Menz][image10]   * **Matthew Menz**   * 01:02:15   * It's a different weather. Yeah.   * ![Ford ITW 1.350][image11]   * **Ford ITW 1.350**   * 01:02:17   * Well, Matt, listen, I will give you the most things to do is to introduce someone else and all the short and sweet Matt, this is your since I've been a part of Mpd. This is the 3rd time that you've visited our class, and I have to say it is a highlight of every winter.   * So your background, your stories, your point of view, is wildly valuable to this group of students. So, from a place of gratitude, thank you for spending time with us this morning. I'll let you talk about your kind of before Amazon, and what you're the floor is yours.   * ![Matthew Menz][image12]   * **Matthew Menz**   * 01:02:55   * Fantastic. Well, I appreciate for having me. It's it's always a. It's always a highlight of my, of my beginning of the year as well, so it's always early. You all you start. So in the middle actually, I grew. I grew up in Iowa, and so I spent a lot of time in the Midwest really brief background. So I I worked trained in graphic design   * did my initial work in in Iowa in a small agency, then went to Boston, worked at a at a consultancy. I think the the most interesting part of that time was I built. I actually came to to California briefly lived here for 6 months   * while we created the 1st walmart.com. So the 1st commerce site in like 2,099. That was a a fascinating time, because, like visa hadn't connected to commerce yet. So we were literally sat next to the the team at visa going. Okay, now, how do you do a payment over the Internet? Let's figure this out.   * so interesting interesting journey. Then I spent about a decade doing hardware and software integration at Motorola. Started a design studio in London, did a lot of work in in Asia as we kind of expanded the the portfolio of of devices. And then, the Google acquisition of Motorola brought me to California, and that was oh, 15 years ago, almost   * and since then I've I've been at Amazon. And so I started at a little group called Amazon web services   * back in 16 and have had a amazing experience the last few years. And I'll tell you, I guess I'll I'll dive in share in the Amazon culture slide decks and having a human talk to you and be a huge face on a screen is very anathema to the culture.   * but here we are. It's it's great. I'll try to keep it brief. So we can. We can have a few more natural conversations as we go.   * ![Ford ITW 1.350][image13]   * **Ford ITW 1.350**   * 01:05:20   * What is it?   * ![Matthew Menz][image14]   * **Matthew Menz**   * 01:05:21   * It's I think it's always important to to have have a bit of a highlight and understand kind of where where we're at and and how we're approaching things. So   * with that I will do a quick share.   * But of course I will share the other screen. How is that? Are you seeing what I'm selling.   * ![Ford ITW 1.350][image15]   * **Ford ITW 1.350**   * 01:05:44   * Crystal, clear.   * ![Matthew Menz][image16]   * **Matthew Menz**   * 01:05:46   * Magic. Alright? So it's it's amazing to be here. Obviously.   * the interesting part about Amazon and Amazon design is, this is what most people think about when they think about Amazon.   * Amazon.com you you immediately think about retail. You immediately think about how the company has really raised the bar for how people think about shopping, and you know,   * arrive getting packages faster. Right? The the interesting piece of this is that as it's continued to evolve. You have, you know, the the invention of prime and then, you know, if you can't wait the whole 2 days. There's teams working on robotics. There's teams working on on drone delivery and a number of really interesting last mile logistics, capabilities.   * let alone extending the Internet access capabilities to the broader planet with with Project Kuiper. And so, you know, there's that that then enables and unlocks a bunch of other experiences that you may be aware of right? So there's prime video.   * There's even the amazing content from Amazon studios. That's that's starting to be happening. So the company's kind of moving more into the movie and video production space   * which is a fascinating place as someone who works at Aws because we're involved in building. The, you know, the volumes, the the 3 60 display walls to be able to have dynamic background within within these productions, to have to to drive   * more localization of content and a lot faster production.   * We also, obviously, can, you know, listen to music all day with with Amazon music, with kindle and and with audible, the the audible audio content continues to evolve.   * Speaking of Kindle. You know, Kindle's really how we reimagined reading   * and it's important in this context to know how this started. It'll be a little bit of a seed as as we talk. Going forward is   * the the notion wasn't. How do we use e ink on a 30 day battery for a handheld book replacement? Right? If you're thinking through a technology lens, that was how you would scope, kindle.   * however. When the teams started to imagine what kindle was, they actually took it through the.   * you know, customers perspective and worked backwards into the logistics side of it.   * And the intent of Kindle was to actually solve the problem, how do you get a book   * anywhere on the planet in 60 seconds like, that's the product. Brief   * and kindle is what emerged from from from that exploration.   * You know, another space obviously, is, is things like Alexa. And really taking those leaps to move from and change, shifting our interaction to how we connect with that content that we're helping to create with our homes and and ultimately with with each other over time.   * Amazon's also working on how to bring those physical digital experiences we've all talked about into the physical space and designing. Just walk out technology. That's something that starts with the Amazon. Go experience the retail experience. But   * it's now in airports, in many stadiums around the world to be able to really simplify authentication and make those moments a lot more magical, a little bit more seamless as we go forward.   * You also have now   * the common layer that holds all of these things together. And I mentioned before, this is this is the place that I've had the opportunity to work for the last almost 8 years. And that's aws. And when you think of Amazon web services, it's effectively a group of capabilities. It's a set of tools, and these tools are what is used by Amazon to enable and empower every one of those experiences that we've just talked about.   * It's things like compute   * storage databases, analytics, robotics satellite, base station communication, and of course, a huge suite of AI and capabilities.   * And it's not just   * Amazon who takes advantage of this capabilities. You know, you probably have already used aws today.   * when you order a car book, a hotel book, a room, use your favorite software package flip on a light. So the the interesting and amazing part of this layer of infrastructure that we've we've been able to build over time empowers, companies, startups, and governments really all around the world.   * So take a pause.   * and yes, Amazon and aws covers a lot of ground. We're really humbled and excited to be part of so much of of people's lives in many different aspects. But just like that kindle moment. The question is.   * so, what right? How how do you achieve these things? How do you go about them?   * And it's not about the technical opportunity. It's not about a go to market motion. It's not about. There's a ton of different ways. Businesses organize themselves to create value for customers and for Amazon. It really starts with customer delight.   * and we express that through our leadership principles.   * and you know, many of you worked in in different ways in in a corporate setting. And I'm sure you've all experienced corporate values.   * you know, the 1st time I was exposed   * the principles I smiled, and I kind of was amused, and I was like, that's very cute. I'm glad you have values because we all see them on every lobby, of every building that we go into. And typically when you work in those companies. You leave the values mostly on the wall in the lobby, and then you enter, and you have the dynamics and the politics and all of those things that happen when humans work when we get together into an environment.   * the really beautiful and exciting part about why I'm at Amazon and still at Amazon in such an engaged way is that   * the leadership principles are a Co, it's it's our behavioral code. It's a way of guiding decisions from   * hiring to performance to business feature trade offs to. How do we think about our our go to market strategies?   * There's these core concepts, and customer obsession is   * no surprise the at the top and it's really our way of anchoring everyone in the company. No matter if you're in last mile logistics   * or you're a designer. You know, we're working closely with an audible or Idb, for that matter.   * It's it's really at the heart of everything we do, and we want to be able to to drive these things through decision making.   * The interesting other interesting piece about leadership   * or there, there's a tension between them, and I'll go back just for a second to highlight this   * because you can have, you know, insist on the highest standards.   * It's about craft and ensuring. The best possible thing is is delivered, but you also have to deliver results which means you need speed and velocity, and so almost every one of these is in tension with one another, and I think that's really the power of them is because it provides us a language for trade-offs   * and for for tensions that always exist right? We want to think, think big and drive really, really big ideas. But we also need to.   * make sure that we've got. We're frugal, and we're not just spending all the money on on 5 year out visions. There's these these interesting tension points that that continue to to go there.   * So how do we do this? I'll kind of walk you through one of the artifacts and a few of the mechanisms that we use internally to drive the the product, the engineering, the design, the research engine of of product development.   * And we, we start everything with this notion of the customer and being customer centric, leading by design and working backwards through a a really shared approach. Because we want to drive everyone who's involved in creating experiences   * to be on the same page and not hand off   * when you hand something off. You fail.   * You want to collectively, collaboratively engage with an artifact or a project through its life cycle, and you want to have ways that new team members can come in and be part of that experience very quickly.   * So one of the core artifacts we use. This is, we call it a Pr. FAQ, so a press release. And then in an FAQ   * Amazon is is his, you know, very historically, a narrative based culture. Yeah, I think. I have precisely 2 keynote presentations that are allowed on my machine. This is one of them.   * And mostly we? We sit down and write. Maybe, you know, next year I'll I'll come and I'll present a 3 page, Doc, and we can. We can all have a 5 min of reading, and then we'll we'll we'll discuss the content, because that's effectively the intent.   * you know, like the 1st time I had that moment I'll tell. Talk a little bit about that is, it's it's a really profound shift when you are exposed to to that way of working.   * So let's break this down. So the 1st piece is is the press release. So this is basically a 1 page   * that anchors the team in who's the customer who will benefit. And how are we gonna share this new capability with the world?   * And the beauty of this is really open to everyone in the company. I have huge number of people in the the teams. I've been a part of that have created Prs, and and you know, this is really the kickoff of an idea whether it big or small. And I think that that's an important   * gauge, because you can always look at the is this a feature? Is this   * feature set. Is this a product? Is this a new business idea? And the beauty of this approach that we take is, yes, you can work at every altitude of business idea. There's diminishing returns as you get more and more granular.   * you don't want to overthink it, you, but the the that that is really the the key is to have a a shared space where people can work.   * and to do that we have to again start with our customers. We need to build and understand their context, build empathy and work across a huge spectrum of abilities and situations. And we use observation, research, conversation, and many, many other tools to be able to drive that understanding.   * But we can't forget, based on those initial highlights like we have to deliver at Amazon scale.   * So we also have to really focus on the full range of customers. And some of those customers are gonna be within our own company. So how are we generating value for those internal teams? So every ounce of value that we can create for someone to, you know, in the retail space, you know, pick faster or in the aws space. You know I work a lot with helping teams. Deliver with more velocity, move more quickly   * every time you do that it's a force multiplier for customer value because they have. They're they're unbound to to create new things.   * So that's the F the Pr piece   * and that's kind of when you tell the marketing story right? This is the no, no jargon. Just who is the customer? What are they gonna value? And you know, how does this change their life? The FAQ is the fun part, because it's really the way that we drive clarity across teams in a lot of these situations. I can tell you how great everything is gonna be. And you, you can easily hide and obfuscate   * parts of an experience that you don't really know what's happening. But with an FAQ, we dive straight in. You know we ask the hard questions. This is all about   * right, like which questions, don't you know the answer to. Yet how could this or would this project fail like we really try to lean into the the harder parts of of the of the conversation.   * And so, you know, as I was alluding to the shift to a more doc based culture, it's fascinating because it's try, you know, every Amazon person goes to another company and tries to replicate it.   * But you know, to different ranges of results. The the fascinating part about this is, and I think it's really based in, you know, 20 years of of coaching and mentoring and and people being the beacons to help guide the culture. But you know I walked into my 1st meeting   * and   * sat down, and they, you know, they send the link out, and a couple of printouts were on the page, and you just sit there. And it was just   * it was silent was the weirdest thing I think I have ever experienced.   * There's no pitch, there's no sell.   * There's just reading.   * And it took me a moment to even realize what was happening, because it felt so foreign   * and and just out of my out of my wheelhouse, and so I like. Quickly I started hearing pages turn, and people were were tearing through the content.   * But what happened after that kind of 10 min period was, I was able to.   * through that form, understand very complex concepts   * presented in a really clear way that had been contributed.   * ![Ford ITW 1.350][image17]   * **Ford ITW 1.350**   * 01:21:20   * T.   * ![Matthew Menz][image18]   * **Matthew Menz**   * 01:21:21   * Probably 1015 people had their ideas represented in that idea in that spot.   * you know, we've been talking for 15 min.   * I could tell you this same amount of content in 2 paragraphs effectively.   * And so the density and richness of the information share is so quick you have to earn the creation. It's a lot harder to write a clear narrative that's not filled with jargon.   * but the   * once you've recalibrated and kind of gotten through that shock you can get in, and you can debate and discuss, and you have the richest conversations because it's really no holds are barred. You really have this fascinating thing as we bring all the ideas and perspectives to the table.   * And so that's kind of the Pr and FAQ. Piece. But in parallel, obviously, these are holistic experiences, and they express themselves in many ways.   * So you know, you saw, you know, the just walk out technology that was prototyped in multiple warehouses within cardboard panels and   * you know, I often have my teams create videos and or or prototyping, or, you know, rough initial code, anything we can do to start shaping and communicate the intent of of the experience. And you know a lot of these things don't have traditional presentation layers.   * you know. It's what what is a a natural language conversation? How do multiple AI agents   * collaborate and coordinate with human? In the loop conversation, you know, insertion points to guide, guide and create guardrails like, there's multiple ways to express this. And so it's a a really important part of that exploration process. Because that's how we you know, rinse and repeat and iterate as we go through. And ultimately   * the the fun part of that. This is that you have kind of a go to market plan, a business plan, a creative, brief, and scoping definition, all kind of comes into one Doc.   * And with this we can do the most important piece. And that's build teams to create this create the idea, the feature, the function.   * And there's a few just basic principles that I'll share as as we go. You know there's a handful of things as we are reading and looking at a Pr. Often will come to a point where we have a 1 way or 2 way door decision.   * And so that's this notion of if I go through it, does it have long term impact? It's really hard to go back one way. Door decision. That's where you want to have people with the most calibration helping with the decision making and the discussion.   * If it's a 2 way door decision. We want every team, every owner to to drive and move quickly, and you can always change your idea. You can always change your mind.   * But defining   * is an idea is a is a choice, a 1 or 2 way. Door decision is a really important piece of it.   * because we really want to drive ownership and accountability as a core part of our principles and into every team. Understanding. Where's your space is? Is super super important.   * The other idea that we look at is is then creating teams. You know. It's you kind of hear this notion of a 2 pizza team, and that allows us to move in a really independent way with smaller groups that have clearly defined scope and can have have total ability to move quickly   * within that within that space. Oftentimes, as you get bigger, you have.   * you know, tens of 2 pizza teams working towards an idea. But we really like to have that organizational design concept drive a lot of the early early and mid stage team team building pieces.   * And so you know, as you have an idea   * as you iterate through with with all of the different teams involved, and you can then start creating a a team to to deliver that idea.   * Whether it's a, you know, a, a a middle level feature into the existing complex ecosystem, or a brand new branch of of a new product, or a brand new entering a new product space. Each. Each one of those becomes a really kind of valuable component.   * You know, the the goal of all of this   * is, you know, I focus a lot on it as an artifact, as a, as a document, as a narrative. But that's just the output, right? The the intent of a Pr is to have a living process where   * it's an open door, where ideas are the currency, and   * we are very hard on those ideas.   * ![Ford ITW 1.350][image19]   * **Ford ITW 1.350**   * 01:26:35   * There you go\\!   * ![Matthew Menz][image20]   * **Matthew Menz**   * 01:26:36   * Easy on the people who create them. And we want to. We want the best ideas to plus and, you know, have have that currency and move through the company.   * We often talk kind of about create, creating and crafting a press release.   * Because, you know, that implies skill and repetition. It's really not easy.   * But it's always worth it. You know. Now I'll leave you with with how this can work. You know I've I've   * I probably review 6 or 7 of these a week   * and in different levels, because they're living documents. They're not just starters. I may come across something that's been underway for a year, and I'll be like I have no idea what that was. Again. Can you send me the Pr. And it's a, you know, 3 min read to get caught up on where the idea is and how we're expressing it.   * And so you know.   * About 15 years ago, 12 years ago. Andy Jassy had this idea of letting customers, you know, lease and use   * capacity in a different way to kind of lease capabilities, and he wrote a press release   * and lore goes. It went through about 40 iterations.   * Before ultimately it was funded. He had started with his, you know, 1st 2 pizza team   * and that Pr spawned. I can't even imagine how many additional press releases, but that became aws, you know. And and a a company that's over. You know, I started 8 years ago, and it was. It was roughly a a 6 billion dollar run rate business. And now it's well north of 100 billion and continues to grow compounded at like almost 20% annually.   * And so it's amazing what is possible to be created   * with this method. It's also incredible to see how scalable it is and how bringing people together   * and and with equality, with inclusion, really helps focus and drive the best outcomes for customers. And and hopefully, all of you experience. You know the benefits every day, and you know the beauty of this whole endeavor is that. And if it's always day, one feels like every day we're we're starting from scratch. And we we have to earn everyone's trust   * both internally and externally, and and you do that by really driving value for customers.   * and I will leave you with that, and then happily dive into questions, or I can eat some bacon.   * ![Ford ITW 1.350][image21]   * **Ford ITW 1.350**   * 01:29:34   * So perfect. I'll kick us off with a question. But I'd love for students to kind of think through your own and engage Matt. So this is your heads up that I'm gonna ask the 1st one.   * ![Matthew Menz][image22]   * **Matthew Menz**   * 01:29:44   * I would just be a huge, looming presence on the screen.   * ![Ford ITW 1.350][image23]   * **Ford ITW 1.350**   * 01:29:48   * Yeah. Yeah. The good thing is, Matt, that this whole class will have a chance to experience and enjoy the Prfeq, because that's their assignment for next week.   * ![Matthew Menz][image24]   * **Matthew Menz**   * 01:29:58   * Good good luck\\!   * ![Ford ITW 1.350][image25]   * **Ford ITW 1.350**   * 01:29:59   * Awfully timely. So we were talking a lot this morning within enterprises, and how to to be an interest organization requires a company to be able to pedal the bike of both sides of the business at the same time. How do we? The current business model, but also extend and explore kind of what's happening   * as it comes to are those useful in both scenarios like within Amazon. If it's an iterative incremental improvement or doing something we already know better? Or are they really for   * horizon? 2\\. Horizon, 3\\. Innovations.   * ![Matthew Menz][image26]   * **Matthew Menz**   * 01:30:36   * Yeah, no. Yeah. It's each elo, each each altitude. It's it's super important.   * Like, I said, there's kind of a diminishing can be diminishing returns, and you've got to calibrate kind of at a team level. How big is a meaningful feature. But   * continual improvement.   * Literally, I I write a continual improvement for the customer experience for Andy every year.   * Oh.   * like, here's here's how we're gonna continue to to iterate and evolve and and get better with what we have. And I write a version which is, here are the big ideas. Here's the customer needs that we that are we've learned about. And here's how we're gonna to to go about achieving those going forward. So we really use them on on both ends of that spectrum. And I think it's it's used in slightly different ways.   * But the core ex exploration for teams is very similar. Who who and what are you gonna solve a problem. For how do you know that? That's a problem? And how are you going to measure the improvement? Right? Like it's a a fairly straight, fit, straightforward.   * way of going about product development. But it is really applicable whether you're, you know, making something 5% better or entering a new category.   * ![Ford ITW 1.350][image27]   * **Ford ITW 1.350**   * 01:32:07   * I have a million other questions, but I want to open it up. Anyone in the room want to ask another question.   * Yes, and I saw that one of the values is, be right a lot.   * What's that? What's that about.   * ![Matthew Menz][image28]   * **Matthew Menz**   * 01:32:26   * The room echo just as you said the Lp. Which one was it.   * ![Ford ITW 1.350][image29]   * **Ford ITW 1.350**   * 01:32:31   * Be right a lot.   * Be right a lot.   * ![Matthew Menz][image30]   * **Matthew Menz**   * 01:32:35   * It'll be right a lot. Yes, yes, that is a fascinating one that we could do an entire, another class. And actually, I encourage you all, I think Andy actually did a video series on.   * I think it's probably on Youtube, on his perspective, on on all of the different leadership principles, but our right a lot kind of as a companion. And this is Matt's view of the world. Everyone will probably have a slightly different read on this, but I see our right a lot connected to Ernst Trust.   * So it's a way of of   * of looking at if an individual, or if testing judgment over time   * like, do you have a great track record of of ideas, of innovation, of of approaches? And you can look at that at a team level, at an individual level? And even at a strategy, perspective like are, do we have the right instincts? Are we right? Making the right calls   * oftentimes.   * we. It's a very data driven company, but it's also a very anecdote driven company. As I was saying, I have a a regular sync with Andy. And this just came up last month, much to my cigarette.   * where we reviewed the data. And it's like incredible through path, and he was like, I.   * I love the story. I think that it shows true. A good, solid trajectory   * that we're creating value, but it's at odds with some anecdotes that I hear. And here's what I've been hearing from other places. And so it's this.   * Are you? Are you? Understanding the intent versus just following the data. So it becomes this good checks and balances.   * And so over time, our right tends to be this this notion of how's the track record? It's a it's a notion of understanding that balance of intuition and and gut, and and making the right calls over time.   * ![Ford ITW 1.350][image31]   * **Ford ITW 1.350**   * 01:34:54   * Hi\\! My name is John. There's obviously a lot of different products under the Amazon umbrella like prime prime video, amazon.com aws kindle. I'm curious, as each one of them evolves. How do you maintain the same overarching brand identity for each one? And how do you like leverage the   * users mental models to make sure that they keep the same experience, regardless of which app they use.   * ![Matthew Menz][image32]   * **Matthew Menz**   * 01:35:23   * Yup, that is the the 100 billion dollar question. I mean, it's in a lot of large companies. Is it a branded house or a house of brands. Right? It becomes this, this distinction. And and I think that there is a   * we. We have a dedicated brand team that looks across.   * a few aspects of that of the experience, the you know, the the traditional traditional brand pieces but then, as that expresses itself in in the product decisions. You know, the the design leadership across the company gets together very regularly to look at the connective tissue and the the threads. But we want to be able to have   * the golden thread of the brand where it's. I understand I'm working with this company. I'm I'm having a relationship with with Amazon, or fill in the blank. But the   * the other, you know, there's a unique, kindle voice.   * There's a unique way of in engaging with prime, because prime.   * you know, it finds multiple channels to express itself.   * And so it's a it's 1 of those things you constantly work at. And every day you find another spot where, like, I think, we can tune this piece. You know it. Working in in different sizes of of company.   * It becomes a lot more straightforward. Because, you know, if you're in a startup, you're in a a company that has a single fairly straightforward product line.   * You can run a script to ensure that brand brand and interaction and experience alignment is tuned in. But when you're a movie studio and a logistics, hub and a like. The you have to   * understand and define that connective tissue layer in a very different way. And I think that we're doing a pretty solid job. But there's, you know, in the grand scheme of things. We've only been at this for 10 years. And so it's it's gonna get a lot better, as we continue to focus on it every day.   * ![Ford ITW 1.350][image33]   * **Ford ITW 1.350**   * 01:37:37   * Yes, Hi, Matt, Hi\\! So   * over time aws has grown so much. And something I'm curious about is how you guys are measuring performance year over year. Now that it seems a lot more incremental than exponential like prior to like getting all the clients you have today. How does that work on a month to month basis and on morale and on measurement. Do you guys recalibrate so that it makes a little bit more sense, a little bit more digestible in terms of growth.   * ![Matthew Menz][image34]   * **Matthew Menz**   * 01:38:11   * Yeah, I mean.   * I'll I'll bring that into a much more kind of personal answer. When I started   * I talked to my partner. And I was like, I I don't know   * what this is gonna where this is. Gonna take me and us like it feels a little bit like I was strapping myself to a rocket. I knew it was gonna go quick, but it could just explode on the or or it could actually, you know, reach the atmosphere. And coming in.   * I just listened and looked to try to understand the business, understand the context, understand the incentives, understand how Pr. And Faqs worked, and   * after about 6 months I had this epiphany I'm like, Oh, that this is how it works. Now I have the footing, and I can. I can engage with the the metrics or lack of metrics. I can help create a new, you know, create a better set of output metrics that are based on the the experience.   * And then, about 6 months later, I was   * kind of having this moment, and I just had an epiphany. This is how it works. This is how we're doing it. And I created a new set of things.   * I've I've now done that about 8 times.   * The the company grew, as you say, I mean, even in our little spot with aws, there were 75 services or or separate businesses   * when I started, and we're now just north of 300\\.   * And so each one of those is, you know, AI didn't exist as a category when I started   * and so every single day. We have both incremental evolution and revolution under underway. At a technical perspective, at a business perspective, at a go to market. I mean, we've released, I think 20\\.   * ![Ford ITW 1.350][image35]   * **Ford ITW 1.350**   * 01:40:09   * You can.   * ![Matthew Menz][image36]   * **Matthew Menz**   * 01:40:09   * In the world from a just from a capability to deliver. And the fascinating part about it, too, is, is there? Isn't 1 aws in a way, because when you look at each that 300 set of of services, there's always a 1020 that are being started. There's a bunch of startups always in play.   * And there's a handful that are 1 billion plus revenue run rate companies.   * And there's this massive group that's in the scaling motion.   * And what every single one of those businesses need, how we engage with them, how we build them, and how they relate to one another is unique on where they are in that journey.   * So having massive you know, revolutionary concepts for a multi 1 billion dollar business is super different   * because you have the inertia and the gravity and the existing relationships. And then so the the point is really looking for those moments of leverage where you can make meaningful change that has that can cascade   * and and affect more experiences with the least amount of input and that's where I think we spend a a lot of our time   * is is in that in that side of it. Because you can increment your way to being very busy and not doing very much especially with the surface area that we work in.   * ![Ford ITW 1.350][image37]   * **Ford ITW 1.350**   * 01:41:52   * Thank you.   * Yes, anyone else, Gus in the back.   * So I see that aws services both the Department of Defense as well as some private contractors as well. Curious to know how you approach conversations regarding data privacy or sensitive information. Typically, when it comes to maybe some of the artificial intelligence services you provide.   * ![Matthew Menz][image38]   * **Matthew Menz**   * 01:42:17   * Yeah, it is probably the   * security and privacy is is the job one for everything we do. In many of those   * arrangements. They're air gapped in a lot of ways where they're simply not even connected to the Internet. And so we focus a lot on data privacy, a lot data sovereignty, which is again part of why we have regions, which is data centers in a number of different countries around the world, because we want to work with those businesses and governments to ensure that there is the data that they   * store with with us, and and trust us with, you know, has very constrained boundaries of where it lives, who has access to it, and   * which is both cryptographically proven as as well as we're always work on more tools to to make it richer. So it's a very, very big focus.   * across the board. So you know, operational rigor and security and privacy are are, you know, the the 3 foundations for how we run services.   * ![Ford ITW 1.350][image39]   * **Ford ITW 1.350**   * 01:43:30   * Awesome, John.   * Hi, Matt, me again. I really like what you said about starting with like the user needs and then working backwards. I'm curious of like what the strategy is to find what the users needs are that you don't currently service and how you know it's a problem that's worth solving.   * ![Matthew Menz][image40]   * **Matthew Menz**   * 01:43:52   * Oh, that is, that's a great question. I would go to a great university to learn about that.   * ![Ford ITW 1.350][image41]   * **Ford ITW 1.350**   * 01:43:59   * Sure.   * ![Matthew Menz][image42]   * **Matthew Menz**   * 01:44:01   * The key piece.   * It depends right with all of these things. If you, if you look at the spectrum of that, we kind of talked about just within aws startups, the scalers and and the established established businesses.   * We have a number of listening capabilities. So if you're looking at   * Max, diff is is a really common way to do weighted trade offs between capabilities. So you can.   * you know, stack rank relative value when you're making incremental changes. That's a really good tool set. Really good methodology. For that. All the way to   * doing right alongs and just having, you know, we we sit with with teams, and we have a product called Connect which is a a call center. We basically will have researchers and designers and product teams, you know, in all of these different areas   * and calls doing doing the work with with that to be able to understand and map   * who are the customers we're working backwards from?   * Because it is it in the call center example? Is it the individual who's taking the call?   * Is it the manager who's managing a group of people and need a slightly different view. Is it the department group? Is it the, you know? So you start to understand the the persona and the segmentation. And then you can start targeting and identifying methods that are are best in a area. So you could say, even to stay within call center. You could say.   * What are the what are the forms that this takes within healthcare versus automotive? So you start taking a a vertical slice and to to identify those patterns. And ultimately it comes down to   * Identifying a rubric for measuring how you want to prioritize all of those in inputs, whether they're coming directly from customers, that coming from research, they're coming from in product feedback. They're, you know, looking at the metrics you have and that tends to be a evolving scale. You know, as as you're early on, it's about   * product market fit. It's about retention and churn rates, and that begins to, you know, to to evolve the things you care about will shift as the business grows, and it's type of, and breadth of customer shifts. So there's a an incredibly fun and diverse set of capabilities that you have to put to bear to to really do that through a business lifecycle or products lifecycle   * the fun and I think super exciting part about   * the opportunity that I've got within aws is, you just see all of them at the same time. Which can both be deeply humbling. But also really interesting, because otherwise, typically, you know, in in a lot of roles. So you you work at a startup or or something, you you'll see a single window into that experience.   * and the more you can speed date companies and and ways of working. I think the richer your experience as a learner and a leader can be, because, solving solving that the exact same question.   * If I was at a startup, I'd answer it in a different way. And I I think that the the richness of the   * the this, the market, the type of business and and the scale of business really helps   * are are all meaningful inputs to answer that question.   * ![Ford ITW 1.350][image43]   * **Ford ITW 1.350**   * 01:47:54   * Let's do.   * ![Matthew Menz][image44]   * **Matthew Menz**   * 01:47:55   * That was the most. That was the most non answer answer. I could have given.   * ![Ford ITW 1.350][image45]   * **Ford ITW 1.350**   * 01:47:59   * Cheers.   * ![Matthew Menz][image46]   * **Matthew Menz**   * 01:48:00   * Yeah. But if one day.   * ![Ford ITW 1.350][image47]   * **Ford ITW 1.350**   * 01:48:01   * More in the back, and then I'll ask one more before you leave. Make sure you have plenty of time to go. Get your bacon mat. Okay in the back. Hi, Matt, I wanted to revisit the security question one more time. I know that there's a directive regarding quantum computing readiness by some 2030\\. I believe I just wanted to know if you are aware of any solutions that are on the horizon   * to comply with that.   * ![Matthew Menz][image48]   * **Matthew Menz**   * 01:48:25   * That, that is, I seem, don't I? We work. We work a lot like there's a we have a quantum group in the company working on all the different aspects of it. But I don't have a massive amount of detail in that space.   * But now I'm interested. I'm gonna go ask them.   * ![Ford ITW 1.350][image49]   * **Ford ITW 1.350**   * 01:48:46   * Take note of that one.   * Okay, Matt. Last one. Hopefully. It's an easy one. It's easy, I think, for us to grasp how amazing the Pr. FAQ. Asset works within a culture who's dedicated to it. Do you have any advice for those of us who want to experiment with this in a non Amazon culture like how to get something like this off the ground.   * ![Matthew Menz][image50]   * **Matthew Menz**   * 01:49:09   * Yeah.   * the interesting. I I think you can look at it as an artifact or as a pro as a process. And the the easier way potentially to integrate it into other environments   * is embody the way of working versus the necessarily the artifact. So if you are in a slide based culture.   * having, have, you know, build collaboratively building that product, that that thing with the same notions of like.   * Let's answer these questions. Let's let's look at the customer's perspective. Let's not take a technology 1st approach. Let's   * those things are very applicable, regardless of the artifact that you that you take the the. You know, the the information, density and communication   * varies based on how you tell that story. But having a living document having a core team having own having someone who kind of owns the pen, we call it. And even though nothing's ever written down anymore allows you to have a   * kind of this notion of ownership a notion of community, and really driving the richness of ideas versus a piece of a specific document or a piece of paper. So I think that that's something that can translate   * fairly well to any culture is, avoid the mine.   * Yeah, I'll I'll show you when I think it's ready.   * Open transparency. Anytime someone can contribute to an idea, it becomes slightly more theirs, which means it all becomes more successful in the end.   * And yeah, don't. Don't ever serve yourself, only serve the outcome.   * ![Ford ITW 1.350][image51]   * **Ford ITW 1.350**   * 01:51:01   * Such a great way to wrap up.   * Matt. Thank you once again. You're the wisdom you shared here is enough for an entire course in and of itself. So really appreciate you spending your morning with us today.   * ![Matthew Menz][image52]   * **Matthew Menz**   * 01:51:12   * I love it. I'm happy, happy to be part a very, very small part I'm super excited. I I want to read all the Prs. Now.   * ![Ford ITW 1.350][image53]   * **Ford ITW 1.350**   * 01:51:19   * Be careful, careful. We have your email address. We can.   * ![Matthew Menz][image54]   * **Matthew Menz**   * 01:51:23   * Exactly right. I'll I'll I'll red line everybody.   * ![Ford ITW 1.350][image55]   * **Ford ITW 1.350**   * 01:51:27   * Awesome. Well, enjoy the rest of your day. Appreciate it, man.   * ![Matthew Menz][image56]   * **Matthew Menz**   * 01:51:30   * Appreciate it. Thanks all. Have a great day. Take care.   * ![Ford ITW 1.350][image57]   * **Ford ITW 1.350**   * 01:51:38   * Okay.   * amazing perfect time for a break. How do we feel? About 10 min? Come back at 11\\. We'll wrap up the module, maybe talk a little bit about some of the lessons from Matt.   * Okay, get up, stretch, go, do some jumping jacks. Another cup of coffee come back at 11 sharp.   * It all starts from there. But everyone   * sure.   * So what do we think of Matt's visit?   * Any initial reactions, connections to what we talked about this morning things that were surprising reinforce a lot of things that we've heard   * like what Amazon does as a company from a lens of which is more solely enterprise and not consumer focused. Yes, yes. Good point. The principles still apply. They do. Yeah, they certainly do. Yeah, which is actually kind of surprising. Like I was with you. I remember, when he 1st came a few years ago, thinking it would be so focused on aws like, how is that applicable? Broadly? But   * it is across the board.   * Some of these lessons, anyone else, anything like good, bad, or indifferent.   * Yes, and I think this Pr's. Things are kind of nice that it's kind of putting yourself at stake   * the sales.   * And I hope this is how it works in Amazon for the right things to happen.   * Yeah, has anyone tried writing a Pr Fpq. Before?   * Yeah, if you would, you mind sharing what was your experience like doing it did it? It's actually very difficult. The way he talked about everything. I was just like this guy's like   * a beast, because it's not easy to articulate exactly the why thinking out externally like, what's gonna perceive answering these questions ahead of time? You have no idea. And then you have to back it up later on. Once you actually ship it.   * it's it's just a lot more than you expect, and it sounds good in principle. And it worked out really, well. It actually is like setting your vision for the future, and then actually building towards it has been very exposing feeling. That's what I'd say. Yes, it's way harder. So I agree. It's way harder to write down a strategy and have it be bulletproof from like every angle versus like pitching it in a time box way.   * And I do think because the way we write it, it lends itself to more critical feedback.   * A typical pitch would be pitches. People know it's a dream. It's a vision. And then this press release. It's a vision and a dream. But it's like, in a very specific template that's like meant to be like, annihilate this person. Almost. Yeah, yeah, thank you for sharing   * anyone else.   * Yes.   * just enough. So it's just enough   * of detail and work on the our students return.   * Yeah, totally. I mean, I have a thing about, I'm sure many people do around the inefficiency of meetings like how much time you spend where you're like. Wait, it's 20 min, and it's like, What are we doing? What's the purpose of this? I love his comment on the process versus the artifact, because the process is like when everyone's governed by the same way of working like we're gonna spend the 1st 5, the 1st 5 min. Looking at this you can. How productive you can be to make decisions, apples to apples across a bunch of different ideas is like, that's the real unlock.   * Okay? So your assignment for next week is going to be writing a Pr. FAQ   * for your capstone based on the format that Matt shared with us today, you can pretty much Google. I don't think John has a format that you can like pick up and copy. But just Google or Bing, if you're into that just pr FAQ template. And like you just kind of run down like the whole thing is, don't go berserk with it like short and sweet is the way to go. But yeah.   * hopefully, that'll be fun for you all to do   * the the key. So having, like Microsoft, has its own version of like a written culture, what I would agree with. I agree with everything, Matt said. But one thing to kind of double click on is the amount of iterations these papers go through is can be like mind numbing like you mentioned with Andy Jassy, the guy who founded now he's the CEO of Amazon, the guy who founded aws 40 different iterations like. Think of how many, how many people, how many meetings, how many sessions you have on that to like, tighten, tighten the screws. It's   * definitely different way of working. Okay? So we have   * 55 min left. Just about I pride myself on never having going over the time   * you. All this is hard to come here for 3 h and be attentive if you've done great so far, so I promise we'll be done before 12, if not right at 12 where we left off was examples of ambidextrous organizations. I maybe have 5 or so more slides of talking and then want to break into a group. We're going to break into different groups. Reflect on what we did today, share some examples with the group and then come back and make sure we're good on the assignment. So, in other words, like the tough parts done, this is like just ending the plane. So   * let's make it fun. So   * how do we help an organization become   * ambidextrous? How do we think about both extending and exploiting   * business models in one fell swoop? And this is where we talk about this thing called the 3 horizons of innovation. I love thinking about taking a portfolio mindset to innovation. Okay, so thinking about, if you're a product team or a leader, or a GM. Or a function owner? How do you place bets in your portfolio that fall into these different horizons, or these different categories   * like, how much are we putting into ideas that are incremental, like optimizing the current business model? How many ones are we going to go back to like adjacencies, whether it's taking the existing product, finding it new markets or taking new markets with new products, and then just   * batshit crazy ideas here, having a place for all of these in the same portfolio is the way to really think about placing bets evenly.   * this might be better as a leave behind. What's what's important is that mature businesses, rapidly growing businesses and emerging businesses all have different focuses and different outputs. It kind of goes back to the 1st slide that we shared around startup scale up and enterprises think about when you're talking about mature business or exploiting. It's more about defending what you do   * like making it bulletproof and finding ways to squeeze cost out of it when you're talking about growing new businesses or scale ups. Think about you've already proven product market fit. Now it's about go to market. It's speed. It's taking a thing and scaling it   * on as big of a globe as possible, or as big of a market as possible. And then, lastly, uncovering options for future opportunities. These are typically the typically the toughest ones to get approval, for because they're going to be measured differently like you might not see. Return in 6, 8, 1012 months. But you're looking for like early indicators that this is where the wind, the wind could be blowing.   * The individual back here talks about the   * offers versus markets. This is just a different way of thinking about this   * right. So if you have a thing that you already do, think about those as like offers or products, so how do you take the existing offers and do them better in the same markets that you're in adjacent markets, whether it's like different demographic, different persona, even different region around the world, or radically new markets? Or how do you think about it in terms of the same people who you already serve? How do you serve them with what you have   * things that you could or should have, or bold new ways of thinking about how to interact with them.   * Does this make sense?   * I love frameworks?   * An individual also mentioned risk and how our risk appetite changes drastically when we're talking about you know.   * exploiting, extending, or exploring, obviously exploring, are the highest risk opportunities. Therefore you have to have different ways of governing and kind of mitigating that risk.   * And let's talk about the 4 different types of risk really quickly. This is from my buddy, Marty Kagan. I talked about it before and inspired. And if you want to oversimplify what modern product really is, it's about systematically reducing these 4 key risks value usability, feasibility, and viability.   * I love the way of taking what is a very complicated broad. It's not the same at every company function that is pm, and think about like, what is our job across startup scale up and enterprises? A Pm's job in today's modern Pm, team is around value and viability. You typically have people who focus more design like Matt on usability and lovability.   * And then your engineering or data science counterparts and feasibility. But your job is to make sure that the customer will buy it, or would choose to use it, and then will it work within the constraints of the business. This is especially true for enterprises less so, less so for startups.   * we talk about the difference between discovery and delivery. I kind of seeded that up front in my introduction, and how these are different mindsets, different processes, and different stools, different tools that have different risks associated to them. When you're talking about discovery. You have to hit on those 4 risks we just talked about when I talk about delivery. You've already proven   * in a positive way that it's valuable people will use it. It's technically possible, and it works in the constraints of the business. So now, how do we scale it? Make it reliable, perform as best as we possibly can, and maintain it in a way that's cost effective.   * Another way to think about it is delivery is where we build things. That scale.   * Discovery is where we purposefully think, build things that don't scale.   * So think of like prototypes. For instance, you're proving positive indicators across those risks.   * The last 2 slides here to go back to our portfolio. Think about delivery being upfront. How do you execute the current business model? Better, faster, more efficient, whereas discovery is more of extending into new opportunities and then net new ground. And I love the 70, 2010 rule if it's just John talked about this one yet.   * So if you are a Pm. Or a functional owner within an enterprise, I advocate wholeheartedly for taking a portfolio view of where you place your bets, and what this should look like is, generally speaking, the ideas in your pipeline or in your backlog, should split out 70, 2010\\. Most of your ideas should be focused on   * executing and exploiting your current business model. Better, faster, more efficient with the people who you serve. And the reason why is. This is your current cash register. This keeps the lights on, keeps you employed, keeps your employees there, keeps you making money. You can't only focus on that with blinders, though, if it's a hundred percent on that, you run into the innovators dilemma where things are happening around you. But you refuse to take your eye off of what you know to be true.   * So then place about 20% of your best into new business opportunities which is existing markets   * and existing offers kind of going up that   * spectrum and then spend 10% of your time on big, bold, crazy loon shots.   * And if you can kind of have this. This is the most defensible way to think about it, of protecting what you have, but also continuously exploring what you don't.   * Okay, let's invite Matt back. Okay,   * let's enough of me talking. Let's break into groups. So what I'd like you to do   * is to break up into groups randomly. I think a lot of your groups are, typically, you get back into the same group with your capstone. I want this to be different. So groups of 3 or 4 feels good, based on where you're sitting.   * I want you just to reflect on companies that you've worked for, either in the past or currently and talk about the way that you, your your observations across how those companies have innovated   * across the 3 horizons of innovation. They could be positive observations, negative ones somewhere in between. And I want you just to share in your own group, like, what are some of the things that you learned? What worked, what didn't work based on what you've learned here today. Was there things that you'd maybe take back to those companies to reconsider? So have nice little conversations around the room, and then we'll come back.   * And let's say 15 or so minutes. Share kind of key outputs. Think of like themes across everyone in your group, and then we'll move on with talking about the assignment and be ready to go. So let's take like 1520\\. Here, I'll set the timer but this is meant to like, get up, change your kind of energy and stop hearing me talking.   * Okay.   * yeah. But that's those are others.   * Yeah.   * yeah.   * going from like completely.   * Yeah, I like   * also went from sunglasses.   * No, no, it's really like, are they? How much are they?   * I don't know how to apply this to my current.   * And now they need products   * in the fifties. Yeah, the military.   * the one that's reaching out   * different, based on your experiences or any groups want to share a couple of things.   * So work for Wilson, sporting goods and we   * just kind of talking through h, 1 h. 2 h. 3, and like how the in age 3, we we don't spend that much time in H. 3,   * and there's not a lot of focus on my specific business units.   * and all of the a lot of the hype goes towards the like rapid sports.   * It's not, in fact, very big in each one, because we we   * are very dependent on companies like Amazon, Target and Walmart. And they're not super interested in the hot new thing. They're more interested in that sock of all sold last year.   * you know. And then with each 2, we're doing a political recreation there where?   * we're introducing kind of new product lines that are like adjacent like sportswear footwear. But then, also kind of doing these things.   * We got a couple of 3 sixties based around like our partnership with volleyball shirts, backpacks.   * You know, it's interesting. We often we talk about Verizon. It's the easy thing to fall into is product   * innovation. It can be the same product. But as we talked about it 10 times that there could be a different service associated with the product business model associated to the product. That sounds like a fun job.   * I would love to know what you disruptive business models or ideas are around.   * Don't deal with Rack too much, but I know that we actually just talked about that a little bit.   * We mostly just make high end versions of stuff.   * That's not what people want. They want. They want to go to target by 1015, $20, pickleball, 10\\.   * Let's go counterclockwise. This group over here, any   * well consulting are very good at Verizon one. So I work really specifically on the delivery side and execution. And so we can like internally, we have a lot of tools that we're trying to push from Verizon one   * something where we have a lot of AI tools that we're trying to push to see how we can better service our clients and also like acquire new ones. But once we actually get like the thing that we're trying to build, we fall into like horizon, one of the client where they already have an existing team that's plugging and chugging along. Because I it's a huge consulting firm. It's like 300,000 people.   * and their output is with really large companies that have existing design system processes and things like that. So while we try to do like advisory roles to push them into more of a number of pieces, they hired us for a contract. We have to deliver that   * thing that they are requesting. Yeah. So it puts us into very much so into the note box, instead of really having areas to explore   * which is tricky, for innovation   * sounds very familiar. I have a lot of stories. I can share that back that up, although the your 1st part around AI super offering and consultants, I think, is a fascinating space. It's not like your ability to get smart in a new area, a new function. A new vertical is like   * 0 cost. Right? I think the expectations for the caliber that consultants bring video engagements, I think, is going through. Yeah. Because one thing that we're building now is how we work with all industries and all sizes of companies within all industries. And so everything that we've built goes into a Llm. That I'm now owning, which is pretty fun. And so we are building a tool that you can go in and learn really quickly about what the like expectations are of a product in that industry.   * Then into your discovery session to help refine the Prds and the briefs that we were going to build off of. And then, once that is defined, then it kind of goes back into business   * without nerding out on this. Are you guys created your own Llm, or are you taking one off the shelf? And then we're fine.   * We structured it. I didn't build it. So I I don't know. Specifically, I joined later. I think we structured it after existing ones with the   * catered it to just consulting practices   * when you're talking about like the outputs that come out, the ideas going into the brief into the documents, like in a good way like that. Right? There should be a way of like super charging productivity.   * Cool. Thank you for sure. Okay, back here. Those are 2 different groups. Right? There's the security row. And then.   * yeah, yeah. And then for ketchup, right for ketchup   * was around our digital experiences, but also high tech.   * We also talked about the challenges and confusion around organization to   * have high direct talent and hydrates.   * I love that while while you were talking it brought something up. Did you say the word acquisition.   * when you're evaluating your portfolio across existing new and disruptive, like the build by partner, scenario of like. If you come up with an idea that is disruptive back to as a company, what's your core competency. And what part of this should you own? Or where should you, partner   * like? That's obviously huge in the role that I have now on Microsoft, because, like the reason why we've had a leadership position is because we   * struck an amazing partnership with Openai. And now we're leveraging ways of like bringing that back into the org. There's been a lot of interesting news around like with Stargate. What that's been announced. Kind of what that means. The future of AI. I will promise I'll share with you whatever I know, week to week. But things are moving pretty quickly.   * Thank you, Jerry. Okay in the back.   * Oh, sure. So one of the things that we talked about spoke about was currently I'm in   * supporting on market product.   * But I come from. I came from a R\\&D background in medical device. And so I have   * good amount of friends and colleagues and R\\&D world, the way that I always think about stuff. It's like, how are we going to support this product line on market? And currently, there's a there's a project with a whole new methodology for   * testing   * And   * what happens really doing is that they're doubling down on stuff that they have in house hardware solutions that they have in house, and they're trying to adopt it to a whole new method of testing. That doesn't quite work. But the hardware is not quite   * one of the things that. And right now the strategy is like, we're gonna throw bodies at this, which is   * kind of working. So one of the things that you you mentioned was like,   * what company ship is a reflection of the organizational structure? Yes, and it's right now I'm kind of feeling I'm worried about this new project because it's going to be very much like we're gonna fix this thing on market. Type of thought process. And being an on market support person right now.   * worried about this incoming product line. It's very exciting. But at the same time it's concerning because of the problems.   * And it's like I'm straddling. I'm within that horizon.   * yeah. So that makes me think of what Matt was saying. Something about handoffs like how handoffs never work like, I wonder, in this scenario, like   * with the new product like, does that get handed off to a team that supports it? Is it the same team that sticks with it. You don't have to share. But like, that's where my mind goes on. And then there's the hardware these 2 things need to need to work together. So like, if one is ready, let's say the biologic. And then the hardware is constantly changing. Then naturally that our chemistry is gonna have to change   * such exciting jobs while I have. This is cool. Thank you for sharing. Okay. Other side of the room.   * I work for accenture. And our sort of 1st process innovation that we did was really get workday implementations right? That's been a big great that was like our bread butter for a very, very long time, and I would say our horizon 2 was the acquisition of, you know, 100 plus agencies that became accenture song. So all of our, you know, customer centric business models. All of our marketing transformation happens through that part of the organization. And   * you know, strategy, consulting side is still exists. It's a bigger arm. But you know it's a little bit more spread out, and it it has. We have many, many different offerings. Our 3rd horizon is the partnerships that we've started. I mean, we've had them for a long time. So Microsoft, you know, in video, we just had, you know, accenture video just got created. Google, Amazon, you name it. And we do these like power of sort of   * products where we design the use case. You're probably familiar with this, and do the, you know, integration implementation of it later on.   * The disruptive angle around partnerships are are there? It's the leading question. But, like I see a lot of services companies like Accenture who are investing in building out accelerators that basically are like, Hey, if you're Abbott and you want to leverage Google's platform for Xyz.   * We've created a way for you to achieve value faster like that. Where would you put that? Would that be a I would actually put that kind of in the disruptive. So, for example, building that capability, building it completely in house that was, I think it's a separate. It's like the products we sell. I think it's the same thing. But in terms of the delivery and the extension, and how the support model that we   * facilitate alongside. With that I think it's a bit of a different model. But I would put it in the horizon 3 around. How do you continue sustain partnership? But, you know, allowing for clients to have a different level of ownership and fidelity over their products, because because they've never thought about like oh, this is something we could explore, and possibly, you know.   * do something more like, I said. For sure I love that you should coin that term. The 1st company that I worked for was called Acuity Group, that was acquired by accenture many, many years ago.   * Awesome, awesome company. Thank you for sure. Okay.   * Tom. What team are you on.   * Oh, God, sorry. Good one. Okay. Who's next   * over here? Okay? And then we'll finish here.   * Yeah. So I work for a company that is called Aero International. So it's a paper based company. So we create or make a full time tickets. This is for charitable industry or marketplace. So basically, our market space was bingo salons and churches. So now we move to horizon 2 by creating electronic gaming machines with a a print on demand tickets.   * which basically, it brings your full tab ticket and validate it on the on the screen. And now we are expanding the market space to bars. And   * Okay, awesome. That's great. Where do you think that goes from? A new disruptive? If you're are there ideas or things right now? We are the only company doing that.   * Last, but not least.   * And yeah.   * that's awesome.   * Thank you for sharing. Okay, I have one example that I want to share, and then we'll kind of wrap up here.   * working with the existing business model and launching something that new, and the the trials and tribulations of org and structure and leadership, and how important that is. So. 5 or so years ago I was working with the company where my customer was the largest   * forklift manufacturer in Europe, the second largest one in the world, and they had an idea they looked at Airbnb. This is just 6 or 7 years ago. Actually, they're looking at Airbnb, and they're like, look, how can we leverage this path, this growth towards the sharing economy, and apply those to b 2 b logistics equipment. What I mean by that is, their largest customers have fleets of forklifts anywhere from like 200 to a thousand   * and   * they're all those customers were only using 70, 80, 90% of those fleet during peak times of the year. So think of like holiday, for instance, the other 6, 8, 9 months, like 70% of that fleet would sit on a yard, basically accruing cost on a balance sheet. So they're like, why don't we create   * multi-sided marketplace, a digital marketplace that says, if I own b 2 b logistics equipment and I'm not using it, I can digitize it, make it available to other organizations that have complementary seasonal cycles. So rather than like buy, they could just short term rent it from like peer to peer. Really, really cool idea. We ended up.   * Starting the company, we launched it. Our 1st market was Paris and Southern France, so it was a really cool to do. Just side note our design research. There was incredible and we ended up launching it. And for the 1st 6 months   * The kpis that we had were like off the charts, positive, like people stopped working with dealers. They started to trade these things back and forth. We took care of things like like logistics and insurance and all that.   * But the reason why the idea got killed within its 1st year is that it was an organizational challenge. So this organization, before this marketplace was created, managed all customer relationships from dealers   * and dealerships. And what happened was the dealer was like neutrally supportive of the idea, because that team never thought that it was going to take off the second, that it started to take off the dealer basically put their arms around it and then strangled it and put it in the back. So I think that's a good example of   * you can have these amazingly new, disruptive ideas. You can treat them with a startup mindset have the right metrics. But if you're not focused on how those things as they succeed get worked back into the organization, and it is the right, the right cultural alignment and top down support. Your portfolio is at risk at best.   * So okay, that's the one story I had just to kind of wrap this up.   * Okay, we have 10 min left, and I'm not interested in running through slides for the purpose of doing it.   * So let's wrap up with our assignment.   * And just make sure these words make sense. I had to switch a couple of things up   * as I talk to John here on my phone? So before the next class, your next class is your 4th class, right? I got that right in your meeting next Friday.   * Okay, it's going to be an individual assignment unless John says anything differently. But I believe it's individual. What I want you to do is to evaluate your capstone project through the Pr FAQ format. So basically create t, 1 of a Pr FAQ, using what you learn from Matt today and the template that you find that's publicly available and have that submitted before class starts on 31, st   * yes.   * Section of the course.   * This is a, this is under the final assignment.   * This currently is, yeah. So I. So it's interesting. I had I when I created these slides today I looked at the syllabus and put the job to be done assignment here, which you all just turned in. Okay? So as that came to be, I was texting John, and he's like we didn't update it. So this is your gold source, I will make sure. John updates the assignment portion in canvas so that that's abundantly clear on when it's due and how to submit it.   * Thank you for drawing that attention. It's definitely a bit confusing. Does everyone feel comfortable taking a stab at this, based on the chat with Matt today. And what's available.   * So for what one capstone projects, we will have like what? 4 prs, so that's the idea. I think. So.   * I'm my understanding is that it's individual like, if John corrects that we can. But I think you going through the rhythm of creating it on your own, I think, is is the whole point. So yeah, it's gonna look and feel the same way. But I think if it's group written and it's 1, i think the experience could be different. So I'll validate with John. And hopefully, by end of day today, if it's different, that'll be posted as an announcement   * that fair good\\!   * Well, thank you for your time. Today it's been awesome meeting you. Have a great rest of your winter, and I'll see you in the spring.   * It's very hot.   * And what's the actual?   * Yeah. So I agree with everything.   * Yeah, I think for me, it's not justified. But there's a way to justify it with the value.   * No, we just kind of went through. The presentation   * like this is this makes sense to execute that. So I would do a value prop side with numbers, and then on this one that you just have.   * I think it's like the overall value problem. This is like a qualitative statement.   * right? It is missing. I was thinking like, Are we going to grow by, you know? Is the time like you can actually figure out what those metrics are right like. Start thinking about what those metrics are. So you know, in in moving jobs over here, we have the opportunity to decrease. I don't know. Product, something, something by increase the rate of.   * you know, to go to market speed by X percent. And then what I would do to get that information, I mean is this like due on Monday. Okay, but I would have a couple of cross functional calls, like, maybe something from procurement in your points are because the pain points be translated into a value versus like having the justification of   * initially checked with our Vp. And he said, I didn't. We didn't have these numbers. It was just fine.   * Yeah. And this one, actually, what we're trying to do here is also, it's getting busier and busier. But they're saying they want to see how each idea.   * Yeah, I made the slides.   * Yeah, yeah, that's fine. I think it's fine to do the numbers. Yeah, I would also make a little bit of differentiation of color. Because if these are the same sort of 3 things that are in another, one or another one, basically, they're creating like a right? So like in these areas, what are the you have? 4 sort of like a.",

              "value": "=* **John Renaldi**   * By these hierarchies is your is your superpower.   * Embrace that to figure out what the bigger guys would do differently, and go where they won't, and have a really good think about this with your capstones as you think about this.   * If a larger company were to uncover your secret, would they have gone about it the same way as you are.   * Okay. I also talked about this idea of making sure that at the very beginning   * I'm gonna throw out all the stuff I said about scaling more operationally focused. This is more around founder mode. Brian wrote this whole thing. You may have heard about it in the press like founder mode founder mode really is. This is making sure you have the pulse on your business and your customer. That's really what it's talking about. Stay close to it   * in the early days, so important that you, as a founder   * or on the founding team, wear those hats and embrace the suck.   * It's not gonna be great.   * You're gonna have to be the accountant.   * You're not doing payroll.   * You're gonna do all this stuff.   * It's okay.   * That's how you learn the business. That's how you learn your customers problems you should be on as a founder. If you are not taking customer service calls   * like you're not an investable business.   * The founder should be taking customer service calls. That's founder mode.   * That's what Brian's really talking about.   * Matter of fact, I'd say that even if you are a leader of a large organization.   * you should be doing some of those things as well. We talked about early, like, how do you bring about innovation changes staying closer to the customer user centered organizations, T-mobile, really great example forcing their executives and their teams to go work in the stores for a week or 2 a year, whatever that thing is for you, but like getting back to founder mode, making sure that you don't lose touch to the vibe   * of what's going on with your customers.   * whether that's jumping on customer service calls, whatever it may be. But you in the early days are the salesman you are the brand. You are the marketing team. You are the research team. So you should be right there talking to your customers. Even as your product is out there in the world. Last night I was on a call with a CEO. I just emailed him. I'm like, I'm using your product.   * fucking sucks, having problems.   * Got an email back this morning from him.   * Pounder mode. That's it. That's what I'm talking about. You know what he's like. Yeah, I got it like.   * I'm really sorry about this. And and I'm like chasing this right now, like I can appreciate your frustration with this. Let me get back to you. Here's some things I'm doing   * amazing, like I'm making his own product better. He's receiving the message he knows to work on it. And like I went from like a negative experience. Now to being like, all right, like.   * I like this guy, I like this company.   * If they can fix this problem, I'll probably be a customer right?   * Anyone know what happened last week, and following deep seek God. If I hear another thing about deep seek, I'm gonna punch myself. So I'm going to talk about it. I'm not going to pontificate on this one. There's enough of that.   * My Linkedin feed is filled of it. But I want to hear from you. Why is this   * super germane to our conversation that we just had?   * What's going on with this? It's very irrelevant to this discussion. Rishi.   * I mean, they've been the whole conversation about how their AI solution and the AI offering that they have is.   * it was actually done at 120 and 1 30 of the cost of what the other incumbents have done it. Yeah, that's right. And how and why do people think like, how do we think it happened?   * Constraints\\! They went and said, you don't have all the money in the world. You don't have the reputational risk to worry about. You don't have to worry about answering every question, the absolutely perfect, exact, politically correct way, and give you all your outs and all this like the way that Google probably would. Right? Like, they're like, don't worry about that.   * Get us, 90% of the way there don't be perfect. Just get us 90, like, what does 90% perfect look like?   * And how would we? And they also, if you read the report, they hired a bunch of people, not from the AI industry. They hired a really smart computer scientists that actually hadn't been taught some of these things and gave them new challenges of like, how would you solve this. If these are your constraints, they just put the constraints at them.   * and they came up with a totally new way, like, put aside, maybe. Yes, it actually costs more money to train the model than they're really saying. Put away all of the other things like, yes, are probably true, like, yes.   * they're keystroking your app, and you're giving a bunch of information to them like, put that all aside. For a moment.   * They figured out a new way. Everyone is going to copy of that right because they did an open source way inspired innovation across the industry.   * but they unlocked a new way of doing it that was   * purely and solely focused on constraints.   * They're like, okay, like, how do we build software basically just more efficient because we've gotten really lazy? We throw a lot of horsepower at something, even as we build applications in our teams in our world like there's so much bloat that's probably in there, and we don't think of it, because the amount of like, you know, on a smaller scale, like really doesn't matter all that much like, okay, if this site loaded and like, you know.   * 10 ms for this one function call versus 22 like, is that really that big of a problem? I don't know. Probably not. But when you're doing some of these operations and training   * billions of parameters like this stuff adds up.   * So yeah, constraints, outsiders bringing a whole different perspective to an industry that quite frankly.   * they don't really know a whole lot about.   * Think about last week Amazon, Jeff Bezos, a bookstore owner, see? Like a domain expert in books.   * Nope.   * Was he a domain expert in any of the things that really Amazon was? No.   * he brought in an outsider's view.   * Who did we have a young, sharp   * rocket scientists that had worked with NASA Jpl.   * And Boeing create the most successful   * space company there is is that the person that did it?   * It's a guy that like built   * an e-commerce app right? Elon Musk took all this money from Paypal created Spacex   * back at that time a lot of people were like.   * what's this guy doing, you know, is Jack shit about all of this stuff?   * Yeah, that's true. So did Jeff Bezos. Many others. Now, we can also cite lots of examples where domain experts invented some novel technology that only they could have. We can look at whether that's going to be the early days of apple with Woz and Steve   * Bill Gates.   * whatever it may be right like these are good examples of like there is some domain expertise there. However   * many, many. The reason why I say this don't be afraid. Right like yes, domain expertise super important to be. And you have to have that on the team. No doubt about it. Spacex wasn't created by a bunch of people. Didn't know anything about rocket science, right? Like he hired the people that actually knew that stuff.   * But the the instigator, the person that's going to start that take the risk like these people like yourselves   * may not necessarily need to be domain experts.   * But your co-founder probably does, or your 1st hired absolutely does right. But don't let that shy you away   * from starting that thing within your current company or not, because this is also something that come up like, well, why? Why do you feel like you're the best person to start up this business or this product area like, you don't have that background or expertise.   * Yeah, that's exactly the point. Like,   * correct. This is why it's important, because I can bring in this fresh, fresh perspective. And here's how I am bringing in this fresh perspective.   * We talked.   * It's probably one of the more relevant. Put aside what you think about the guy like facts of the facts? Didn't know too much about rockets.   * Richest man in the world didn't know Jack shit about rockets completely innovative. The entire industry can insurance.   * So can insurance created out of   * an industry that would have been like really boring, not very innovative.   * and said, Well, what if we approach this space without their constraints, what would we do differently? How could we go into markets where there's insurance companies are pulling out   * because they don't have the data. They don't have the way to uniquely quote a very particular scenario. So you've got like screw it. We're just out of Florida. We're out of South Carolina. We're losing money on hurricanes.   * but you know what there's money to be made because some of those houses are built out of like they're like tanks.   * They didn't get hit, I mean they got hit, but they survived   * now they were few and far between. So for State Farm they're like too much of it. Too small of a market.   * Well, yeah, in that one or 2 places, but if you aggregate it all them together, they're actually a really awesome business opportunity in big markets. So Kin said, Well, what if we could customize all of our quotes by multivariable factors? So we would actually ensure that house that was made out of concrete on the beach. Every other company would have ran away, and they're going in.   * and they're going in and winning that business because they're going to be at a rate that's like attractive. It's not sky high. It's not. I didn't jack up the rate 3 or 4 X, maybe, like the State farm in the All States. They're coming in at reasonable prices because they're like, you're the low risk person, like, of course, I'll insure you like your house ain't going anywhere, man.   * all of this is really the point of that innovator's dilemma. Hopefully. You've read all of it by this point in time from Clayton Christensen. This idea of the incumbents.   * how you go about in a larger company. We've talked about ways where you can not fall into this trap. What you can do to ensure that, whether it's an innovation strategy of acquisitions, whether it's focusing teams and efforts on horizon 3\\. Reinventing yourself staying very true to the why and continuing to challenge your own business. I think Google actually has done.   * If you would ask me this about a year and a half ago I would have had a different answer.   * Google's done a pretty good job at not succumbing to the innovator's dilemma like their legacy business of search like it.   * Most other companies, honestly, would have been like, we got to protect this thing. This is our cash cow like, but they like embrace that AI could actually threaten that business itself, and, like, put all the chips there   * that could actually like disrupt themselves. So this idea of disrupting from within is next week.   * But like, how do you embrace that? How do you like? Not protect that? I mean, most companies will protect most companies will be like, no, we're not going to touch that. That's too risky. That's too scary that this new thing we're doing over here puts this cash cow thing at risk. We're not going to do that. But how do you embrace that   * talked about? I think most of these things. Okay,   * here's an example. Procure a company that does kind of started in this idea of starting small and scaling, focusing, having monopolies and small like all of these things that we've been talking about with focused starting small scaling rapidly right? Having a very clear focus.   * Say, like   * too many companies will do like the 1% of a big market right like. Never show that like you'll get laughed out of a room like it's got to be like. No, we're going to dominate this beachhead.   * It can't end there. You can't just be like, this is our market. But it's like we're gonna rock this entire market. And then, as we do, it builds our flywheel, because it actually helps us move in to the next market.   * and that unlocks, then the 3rd market. So you should always be talking about where you're going you're selling. If you're pitching the Vc. Like you're selling the vision, you're not just selling your 1st thing.   * You're selling the whole thing. So you have to talk in multi-generational terms. But you're also saying like, that's where we're going. That's the big idea we are going to completely disrupt blah blah.   * But this is where we start.   * and we show them the roadmap for how we get to that longer term vision. But where we start it's going to have a niche. It's going to have a focus suite, one market   * whatever, like one specific type of customer.   * And the way to think about this, this is from my friend Jackie and her company at grid capital.   * I love this. It it allows you to think and and you need like. This is definitely one to refer back to like, think through your customers   * that have, like, they all have a similar problem or the same problem. This intersection, this Venn diagram of of people that have the same problem looking for the same solution and the same buying behavior.   * Because if one of these things is actually different, it totally unfocuses you like, okay, I'm going after this market. I'm building a project management software cool like this. Company has this type of customer has the same problem cool. They have this problem. I build the software. They're looking for the same solution. Yep, check.   * But oh, like   * this company has a super long procurement cycle. And this other type of company has, you know, blah blah, or this other company like you start to figure out like one of these is out of whack and like you no longer have that focus. So like you have to be like, all right, our target, our focus is customers that buy. Similarly.   * they all have the exact same problem, and they all have the exact same sort of what they're looking for as a solution. And of these I think, most people, the 1st 2 thought about pretty clearly like we talk about that in our classes through the program like, that's where we focus most of our time.   * And it's the 3rd bubble that we actually don't.   * And so that's why going back to the slides earlier, like thinking about where your competitors won't go thinking about buying behaviors like these are all additional signals are for focus   * and allowing us to focus on that 1st market. Yeah, we're going to dominate all of them down the road, got it check. But like right now.   * we're going to focus right here and completely own this, blow this out.   * dominate this market, and then we'll move to the next.   * all right. So we alluded to this. But it's important to know, because it's going to set up the context for some of our additional discussions, and it's around understanding venture capital. And certainly we don't talk a lot about that in our courses. This is not an entrepreneurship program, but it's important for you to know, because we're talking about innovation in a startup and how it's different from a larger organization.   * It's important for you to know the mechanics of how this works and what they're looking for. Most people don't really think about some of this stuff.   * But the reason why we have to move with speed, and we have these constraints is that these funds have limited life.   * 10 years.   * They've got 10 Year Fund life they've got to in that 10 years return capital to the investors.   * and if you work back from there, you got to think about what the expectations are of the limited partners. The people that are writing checks into the venture capital fund, and what their expectations on return are.   * and all of this will help illuminate. Why they do the certain things they do and the expectations they have, because whatever investment they're making right, each of those bets   * they have to believe is going to be like a return the fund event, meaning that the exit from that one company   * could return back the entire Fund pool right just from one, and and I don't know which ones are going to win and which ones are going to lose.   * So I don't just invest in good as as a Vc. I just invest in good businesses.   * Lots of great business they made. They're like, I think you could definitely be a hundred 1 million dollars business. And you'd be like, oh, that's amazing. Like, I didn't even think I could be a hundred 1 million dollars business like you should invest in me. And they're like, yeah. But our fund size is 800 million dollars fund.   * So I have to believe you   * could be a billion dollar exit like, I can't believe that you're just a hundred 1 million dollars business like, I have to believe that you're a billion dollar business because you have to theoretically return my fund.   * And so it's like thinking about matching fund size right to that. But the point is, they all act the same. They all have to have this return the fund approach, and in order to do that. You have to have this type of growth expectations   * which means, like you back back up into all of this stuff, and how you think about your raising like. All right, I raised this much money. Well, the valuation expectations at like the next round go up.   * and if I don't back into that with revenue I'm screwed. I'm done like it. All forces this concept of constraints.   * and from a capital perspective. Vc. It's good for you to know some of this. But this last bottom right piece is what I wanted to really talk about, which is like   * there's a new way that's coming.   * And the new way that's coming is because, like we said earlier, the old way was, raise 20 million dollars and hire 500 people.   * That's not happening anymore.   * Because I can do these things with a much smaller number of people.   * I can do this with less than 10 people   * what usually would have taken 2 or 300\\.   * So I don't need to go raise 20 million dollars. And, by the way, if I do, it's because I want to acquire something I want to like it's for growth. It's for customer acquisition like it's not to buy and build up like a huge 200 person engineering team anymore.   * So if I don't need that much money anymore.   * And maybe I'm actually okay, growing more at like, maybe I don't need to triple triple double double. Maybe I'm cool with like   * 1.5 to 2 every year, seems pretty good.   * What if I could just like be profitable   * with like 1.5 to 2?   * What if I could like actually grow to startup scale like, get into the tens hundreds, millions of dollars of revenue, just doing like   * 2 x growth every year   * and being super profitable. Taking those profits, distributing back to my employees like, I'm a business 101   * wasn't like super possible to do because of technology. Economies of scale got there only after a certain scale you could get to that point, which is why you invested and would lose money in so long that you knew. With the economies of scale you could become the Google, the Amazon and make lots of profits. Profits are always the goal.   * They just maybe aren't realized for a while.   * but if you're thinking about starting a business or an enterprise like you can now   * go off and build that company, and maybe not have to raise from venture capital. The idea of bootstrapping and being profitable is within reach. I only maybe need one developer.   * And what can me and one person if I hire them as what   * a missionary\\! If I hire a missionary, not a mercenary, and we've got 2 missionaries on on this thing   * probably way more powerful than like 10 mercenaries that I went out and hired right. What can the 2 of us do? Totally driven.   * and then not have to go raise from Vc.   * So, as I say, this, this is a company raised from BC. But the idea is that they're a smaller than 10 person company. And look at this quote that he's putting out there is like, we are going to be the 1 billion dollar company with less than 10 people   * like we talked about this early in the class, and maybe the 1st day, like the Comp. We said, like, what is that company? That company has already been started?   * The company already exists. We don't yet know which one it is that company already exists   * less than 10 people Unicorn going to be happening soon.   * and we're seeing this across the board the rise of the solopreneur.   * I don't necessarily need this right away to have a huge team.   * I can go ahead and give myself the ability to be a force multiplier through different tools that are available. Now that we're not available for those that like join some of our office hours and have seen that we talked a little bit. 2 classes ago, agentic prototyping, the ability to get something out super rapidly used to be like I'd spend 2 weeks in the field. Then we spend a 2 week design sprint and a build sprint just for, like, basically an envision.   * clickable scripted prototype. Right? Like that. That's how things were done like 2 years ago, a year ago we go back out of the field, put that as part of our stimulus like that. All can now happen in like 5 min.   * right like, apply that across everything that your company can do from operations to customer service. Every out customer outreach cold emails lead. Gen, you name it. Like all of these things, can be. OP. Can be optimized and automated from day one.   * And as you think about the types of things that you can automate if you're thinking about building a business.   * Don't kind of fall trapped to this   * like. See this all over. I did talk about this in like Class number one, which was like the number of companies that pitched me like, we're an AI, this and AI that like   * this is a trap as well, because it's sort of like AI for AI's sake, and like the foundational models, are like becoming so bonkers that they're just going off. And then like displacing this like, we're the AI for whatever. Because now the foundational model just can like do that. So I don't really need you to do that for me anymore? The foundational model did it.   * So your idea is like to think through what problem are you solving? You're using AI as a tool. Do not let yourself be that we are the AI company.   * because I want to hear what problem you're solving, and you may just be using a just like we talked about in the early days like, I wouldn't go out and tell everyone right now, we're a computer company because we use computers and servers like, yeah, I get that like, that's part of your tool chain. I expect that. What problem are you solving? Tell me about that.   * And as you think about this, we're not going to go through all of this right now, because we're going to reinforce more of this next week as we talk about disrupting within. But how do we think about opportunities where we could apply AI to that problem?   * There's a trap. And the one thing from this slide you can read it. The one thing I want to reinforce of this before we get to our guest speakers   * is that when you talk to customers. And you're thinking about to do this.   * Think about the most valuable part of that value chain with a customer.   * Don't put AI necessarily on that.   * Think about AI first, st how to automate the stuff that is taking up their time so they can focus more time on that thing.   * on the thing that adds the most value. Think about everything you do with your customer. What's the one thing that if you could get rid of everything else, that's where you'd spend all your time, one because it's the most valuable thing and 2\\. Maybe it's because it's the thing you enjoy the most. The thing that you get the most enrichment out of imagine. If AI just only did all the fun stuff at your job, but gave you all the shitty work like.   * I don't think that company is going to be super successful if the founders think in that way. But like as you start a small enterprise, think about those things that are going to drive the most value. How can you spend more time talking to customers?   * How can you spend more of your time engaging with those bigger customers. How can you spend more of your time building up your funnel.   * worrying about growth?   * AI can then help me automate all those other things   * that I don't want to spend time on.   * Take up and take my my eye off the ball. Those things can work in the business.   * Well, I work on the business.   * How can I take AI to have it work in the business to free up my time to work more on the business?   * Okay, guest, speaker time, do we? Do? We have Adam online?   * Yeah, yeah, not yet.   * Boy, I sure hope you're here. I sure hope I sent him the zoom link which now I'm thinking about it, it's very possible I did not.   * So let's go ahead. What we're gonna do is this, we're gonna take a 5 min quick break. We have one of our speakers here. The other person's on. Zoom. So let's take a just a 5 min. Quick break while I go to email check in with Adam. Make sure he's set, and then we'll come back and start with our guest speakers. All right. 5 min.   * Can you let me, let me move over here and figure out, yeah, yeah, do that   * with it.   * Okay, if you could send an email, the link to Adam.   * yeah, and give him all the information like, just tell him, like, Hey, contact me if you have any problems.   * I wasn't able to work this out. I taught in this very class.   * Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I do. So   * you got a little feel for like, right? I'll do. Kind of a sit down.   * You don't have any slides.   * So I will introduce the 2 of you. First, st there's somebody online. And they   * so right now   * is on Adam. Can you hear us? Okay, online.   * ![Adam Tilton][image1]   * **Adam Tilton**   * 00:31:08   * Hello\\!   * ![John Renaldi][image2]   * **John Renaldi**   * 00:31:12   * Hold on\\! Let's figure out audio. Can you? Say a couple more words for us.   * ![Adam Tilton][image3]   * **Adam Tilton**   * 00:31:17   * Yeah, sure, can you? Can you all hear me? Okay.   * yeah. Is that better? Can you hear me now?   * Can they hear me? Can I get a thumbs up.   * ![John Renaldi][image4]   * **John Renaldi**   * 00:31:50   * It's like, really.   * ![Adam Tilton][image5]   * **Adam Tilton**   * 00:31:56   * Very loud on my side, so it's hard to hear you. And it sounds like what you're saying is, it's hard to hear me, too.   * Yeah. Is that any better? Can you hear me now?   * ![John Renaldi][image6]   * **John Renaldi**   * 00:32:43   * All right, we're gonna go ahead and get started.   * We've got 2 guest speakers, one online and one here with us in person. Mert is the 1st person that we'll be talking to today. Mert is a serial entrepreneur he started a company just recently called Geppetto.   * That was an AI tool for Sdr, so things like cold outreach bots that go out and try to build leads and new business and growth for companies. He's pivoted that business into a newer business. I'll let him talk a little bit about   * previous to this. He sold his company swipe sense and then spent a little bit of time in venture capital as an eir at math venture partners I've known Mark, for I don't know. 10 years, ish.   * and he's 1 of my- my favorite. He's, you know, tied with Adam of of.   * ![Adam Tilton][image7]   * **Adam Tilton**   * 00:34:06   * I'd say.   * ![John Renaldi][image8]   * **John Renaldi**   * 00:34:08   * Share a lot of the same vibes as you're gonna see lots of good energy.   * And so that's Mark. He'll be talking to you guys 1st a little bit about his business, how he got started and thinking about innovation through the lens of a startup.   * Now Adam.   * Adam and I have known each other even longer, probably about 15 years at this point in time now going on   * no. Adam and I both started our companies at around the same time, started a little earlier than myself. He spent some time at Nike at levels, and now is starting his own company again called driver. AI   * and he'll be chatting with you guys a little bit about about that business and and the problems that he identified through that and so after we chat with both of them, we'll each time talk about about 15 min, and then I'm gonna bring them together, and we're gonna have a joint conversation about some of the topics that we've covered in class, and then leave a little bit of Q\\&A at the end in terms of timing. We're gonna try to wrap this all up right around 1030, ish.   * and then we'll take about a 10 min. Break that, you guys flex a little bit, and then we'll start our in class exercise all right, thumbs up alright. So let's respect our guests with laptops.   * and with all of that I'm going to hand things over to Merck, and I'll be back in a moment.   * Thank you. Thank you for being here. Thank you all for hearing me out. It's good to meet you all.   * As John said, I kind of lived entrepreneurship on these 2 extremes. My 1st company swipe sense. We raised 24 million dollars in Vc. We were very much that we've got to hire dozens, hundreds of people to get anything done. Anyway. This is way too loud.   * Can you guys hear me? Okay, can we do without the mic? Is that all right? Can you hear me without the mic? Perfect? I'm gonna put this away.   * basically a lot of venture capital sort of ties you to a certain path. My current company 2, 48 is a bootstrap business. To give you guys real numbers. We started in June of 2023 in the past year and a half ish. We generate over 1.2 million dollars in sales with a team of 4\\. Our team has me, my Co. Founder and 2 full stack engineers. The the example that John was telling you about like you don't need a lot of people to get a lot of things done is very real. I'm living it right now.   * 248 is an agency. So if you imagine when the Internet came out, it would be a pretty good idea to go to brands and say, Hey, I will build you an e-commerce website. When the iphone came out. If you were to build a mobile app agency, you could go to people and say, like, hey? If you have, Chang, I think you should have a mobile app. That was a pretty good business. I am doing that right now, but by building insanely custom, large language, model applications. I go to companies and I say, Hey, I think you have a problem.   * and I think we can help now what problems we choose to solve is an interesting question. And this is something I want to double click on a little bit.   * I have a fundamental belief. This belief is stolen from Y combinator.   * I believe businesses create value for other businesses. In one of 4 ways you guys are learning the jobs to be done. Framework. I love that framework. I think Bob's your genius. I'm not as smart as Bob, so I'd like to simplify this a little bit for my own purposes. I think there are 4 jobs. I think if you do one of these 4 jobs, you're successful. If you do 2 of these things, you're going to be a big business. If you do 3 or more, you're going to be a massive company.   * These jobs are the following, you either help another business make more money.   * You either help another business save more money. You either help another business, save time as in move faster, or you either help other business. Reduce risk. Let's let's go over these things together a little bit. Let's start with the 1st one making more money.   * What? What business makes other businesses make more money. Anybody have any ideas, anything. Amazon, Amazon. How does Amazon help others make more money? You can sell your products through there. It's a really good way right like Amazon, can go to another business and say, Hey, you seem to be selling socks. How about you? Sell your socks on our marketplace? You make more money. What else? Any any other things? This should be lots of examples, right? Like what other example?   * Go ahead, pay systems like   * paypal, or like venmo, famous payments like, Hey, more people can pay for your stock. Great, you you made more money as a result of stripe is another example like, go ahead.   * Facebook advertising for small business, too, like   * Instagram ads like, Hey, come to like like, you think of these things as consumer applications. But the reality is they're business money making enterprises. If you help make sell ads to other businesses, they'll make more money awesome save money. What business apps helps other businesses save money.   * Any ideas. Go ahead. Aws\\! Aws\\! How it actually scale quickly without having to worry about. You don't need to have a warehouse of servers that's going to save you some money. Awesome. What else?   * Super freight super freight? Yeah. Lior came and spoke to you guys, I saw the notes inventory don't lose your shit. Right? Yeah, you'll save some money. Okay? Great awesome. I use quickbooks. For example, this is another example. I keep track of, like, what service usually don't use. Okay, move faster. What apps help you save time. Move faster.   * Jira. Jira. Yeah. Sprints get done faster. Right? Like to do is get okay. Great. What else?   * Applications that allow for you to multi list. So across airbnb, verbo, and house away so small businesses awesome that also kind of taps into make more money right? Because now you can be listed in multiple places. Awesome. Now we're doing more than one thing. What else?   * Driver, driver lets you move fast Adam's company, because you don't need to spend hours and weeks in creating technical documentation. If you actually pull up the driver website, the 1st 2 words you see on that description is save time same time. So you don't have to do this like, it's a very clear, direct value proposition. Let's talk about the last one. Reduce risk?   * What? What? What business tool insurance companies, right? Business insurance.   * what else? Like heroes, cyber security, right.   * private private personal bodyguards, or something reduce risk like these are the 4 ways.   * Now, what I do in my day to day, as someone who goes to businesses and say, Hey, I think I can create more value for using AI. I rarely talk about AI. I'll give you guys an example. From this very week I had a meeting on Wednesday I went to Stv. Architects downtown. It's beautiful, by the way, like work from home is great.   * You step into a fucking architecture office like like   * intelligence, plus 20 multiplier like just to like. It's so inspiring to be around those 24 models. Beautiful view. It's an architecture firm. What do architecture firms do they design buildings? And they sell those plans and designs to other constructors to make more buildings.   * And they had this idea.   * They were like Merck yo.   * the building codes are really, really complex. If you guys, building code is like a tomb of just how, where does a window go? Someone outlined this and wrote this out in a document.   * How far should the door be from the entry way? How accessibility works in elevator acts? All of those things are really, really complex   * for Chicago. It's a tomb.   * Every city and state has their own code. It's insanely complex.   * So they were thinking, you know, we have this like massive problem where we need to have like experts like, is this a lot of like brainpower to have within the firm to like, know what to do with what? What goes. And there's this real issue, because whenever we finish a project and the project goes to construction.   * the construction firm often has these Rfis request for information, meaning that they're building the building. They get to floor 7\\. And there's a discrepancy like the plan, says this.   * But this other part of the the brief says that like I don't know how to what's the code, and they basically issue an Rfi to our extension from and say, hey? There's a confusion here. You need to respond to us. The   * architecture firm is rated on how fast they respond to these Rfis. If they take longer than a certain amount of time. Things get longer to build. If things are longer, things are more expensive. So the architecture firm is a real incentive to actually get those Rfis done faster.   * So they asked us, could you build this? Ask   * the code of all codes like to create this for us? It's interesting.   * What does this do? If we were to build this like? Let's say, we now have this code expert that you could just   * ask if any part of the code anywhere else. What would be the net business value like to the architecture? From? Why, why should they care about this upon those 4 things that we care about. It's saving more money, but also saving time. Yeah, it saves them money. You don't have to hire a person who's an expert on these things great. It's also faster, right? Because that person will slip to look shit up like a person, no matter how big of an expert they are. They're not an expert in all building codes everywhere. Great\\! It's pretty good   * in that meeting. I push back and I go. Is this really like the biggest problem that you guys have   * like, if we have the superpower   * or with AI, what else can we do for you? I wanna hear from you guys imagine you're me in this meeting. You're talking to the partnership of an architecture firm. What else could you do for them? Let's try to answer that question. How do we help this architecture from make more money?   * Yeah.   * Make better plans, sure. What else?   * Go ahead, maybe reducing the time of their workload so they can take on more clients. Very interesting. How could we help an architecture firm? Take on more clients? What's the bottleneck to get more clients for an architecture firm? Go ahead. Lots of administrative tasks.   * lots of administrative tasks. Okay, what? What are the administrative? Let's try to break down new customer acquisition for an architecture firm. What are the Admin tasks that get that go ahead creating the materials for an Rfi. So being able to source from past projects, past examples being able to kind of put together. Something super personalized.   * speed is something that usually takes a lot of time. Absolutely. This is what I brought up in the meeting. Now, a little terminology change here.   * Architecture firms put out proposals. So if O'hare is gonna build a new wing, they put out an Rfp request for proposals, hey, architecture firms come up what you think how we should do our building   * and the architects. Firms go ahead and prepare these like large proposals for them and say, Hey, this is our vision for it. And 80% of all this proposals are basically the same. The 20% is the seasoning on top that the architecture firm makes their own. So in that hour long meeting, we basically went from, Hey, this is great. We could be responding to our advice. But you know what else would be really cool. How many proposals do you put out per year? They're like about a thousand. Okay, so about a hundred a month, more or less.   * What if we get you guys to put out a thousand proposals a month?   * Everything the same.   * You just put out way, more proposals you reach out to way more Rfps. This is a good sort of representation of how I think we're in the world.   * In that meeting we were elevating the value because you can still do the Rfi stuff. You could still do other things. But the net net. If I were the manager of that architecture firm. I want to make more money. I would like you to help me and show me how to do that.   * and what success to me looks like in here is that this isn't necessary. We're not selling them. AI.   * I'm selling them a thousand proposals per month.   * and that's something that a human cannot achieve. This is sort of like our ethos. At 2, 48, we build insanely custom things that you can't buy off the shelf.   * I'm on the side of my customer. If there was a proposal generated, they could just go and buy for 99, 99 a month, I would tell them, hey, you guys should just use this ultimately. That's better for you. It's better for me. I'm on the same side of the table as you are, and this to me is what I think healthy product, customer discovery looks like you're on the same side of the table as your customer like. Sit down with them and say, How do I unblock you to achieve better objectives in your life in your world?   * Here's another example I want to share with you guys something that we have built that worked out. And then I'm gonna share with you guys, something we built that didn't work out. And I'd like you guys sort of like, create these things across one another.   * One of our customers is a marketplace they're called Reposit. They're now part of C event they're the largest trade show organizer in the United States. So if you were planning trade shows, event is the biggest one. Reposit is a marketplace that they bought.   * and it's for group travel. So reposit basically allows you, if you're a travel plan, if you're a travel agent, you can go to reposit and say, I'd like a reservation for 80 people in a restaurant on this date. For you know the Uber freights corporate retreat, let's call it.   * You can't just go to open tables. There's very limited options for these large reservations, so reposit is this marketplace. They have a lot of like travel agents within them. Whatever travel planner raises their hands. The reposit team members go out there and find these reservations, and they facilitate these transactions.   * They came to us and said, Hey, we'd like sort of   * help. There's a lot of back and forth.   * because whenever a travel planner raises their hand and says, Hey, I like a reservation for 80 people. They typically have other expectations as well. I'd like to have Vegan food options. I'd like to have this level of a budget involved. I'd like to have outdoor seating. They have all these checklists.   * And typically whenever a restaurant writes back in their responses to these requests, they leave some details out. They might not specify if they can do vegan options, or if they might specify if they can do outdoor seating. So typically someone from the reposit team has to reach out to those restaurants and say, Hey, but you know, great\\! You can do that. But could you do this other thing as well? This creates unnecessary friction inside this marketplace.   * So for them, we built this travel, planner.   * it's powered by AI, but no one involved knows that it's done by AI. It actually more or less looks like another employees, actually has a name. Its name is Taylor. Taylor works for reposit.   * and whenever an Rfp. Comes in, Taylor immediately reads that creates a readable checklist because channel planners also don't follow a perfect format. They'll just write out exactly what they're looking for.   * Taylor reads and I go. Okay, checklist, Vegan options outdoor seating 80 people budget 80 bucks per person. Alcoholic options, not alcoholic options, creates this really nice structured output.   * Then it goes through the past bookings on their history and says, Okay, who else can do this? Within that mark within that market that they're looking for reservation center reaches out to all of those restaurants and says, Hey, I have a reservation opportunity for you. Wanna make more money.   * I I like this a lot because for that marketplace for for the restaurants. Great\\! I'm gonna make more money.   * gathers the responses. If there's a discrepancy, writes back and says, Hey, you left out the Vegan options. Can you do Vegan options as well.   * facilitates more and more of these interactions? This works so well that Stephen want reposit because of this capability?   * I'd like to hear from you guys. Why do you think this works so well? Why is this implementation successful? Why did plan pilot work out any- any insights. I shared a few already, like restaurants. Make more.   * somebody. But what else?   * Go ahead. You're actually replicating human behavior, and but without the issue of keeping morale up and speed and efficiency, and all the things that we typically find with human   * employees.   * You said something I really really enjoy hearing. They were already doing this   * like one of my. One of my favorite sort of examples of shortcut innovation is, if you are around the University campus, see the beautifully paved roads out there, and like they're they're walking around. I went through as well. You see, see this around campus a lot.   * There's a paved road, and then if there's like a sharp angle, there's often like a little dirt path that's like in the, you know, in between, because people just like walk over it. They don't follow the path. I think the greatest sort of path innovation is just pave that path.   * do the thing that people are already doing in sort of like a much more efficient, faster manner.   * What else? Why else? This is a good idea. Go ahead, I love it. Go\\! Get the next customer, do the thing that John was talking about. This is the thing that I can't do. A travel. Planner, travel, planner, you go out there and get more clients. We'll handle all of this back and forth for you. And, by the way, isn't it kind of nice that we now have more responses? Because maybe you were choosing between like one of 2 options. Now you have, like 10 options.   * comes down great. We just save you more money. We help you move faster.   * This is what success looks like for us. Now, I'm gonna share with you guys an example. I'm gonna wrap up and turn it over to Adam.   * or something that didn't work out so well.   * One of our customers is a Fintech company called Spot on   * spot on is, I think, the 4th largest pos provider in the United States. They use credit card so if you're a restaurant like the terminal, like toast is one of their biggest competitors.   * and they get about 30,000 customer support tickets a month   * really high volume. But if you can imagine restaurants   * ask, you know their businesses as well, and the is a core part of their of their operation.   * They have all kinds of customer support. Hey? I wanna make a mini update. I wanna make this product no longer available after 5 o'clock. I just hired a new server. Can you add a new server to the system so they can log in and like calculate tips. All kinds of like menial   * tough to do like technical things on the pos system that they ask the the spot on team to do for them spot on team. By the way, is a team of 500 just doing customer support tickets. If you think about how insane the volume here is 500 people. All they do is these kinds of like right? Let me help you debug the the printer. That's not printing. I'll help you add a new location. So on and so on.   * So they came to us and said, Hey, you know, we'll be really amazing.   * We have this giant library of documentation on how to do stuff, you know. Like, if you were to like like a basic example would be, I forgot my password. How do I reset my password. Well, there's like 7 steps, you, you know. Click forgot password. You'll get an email click on the link like it's very detailed outline.   * All of these things are in a beautiful, well organized well, when we started, was not so well organized. But it's basically this is knowledge base of how to do anything within their within the pos terminal.   * They're like, Hey, I wonder if you guys can build an agent that reads the documentation so that anytime a customer asks us to do something. They get an SMS message from an AI agent   * and says, Hey, my name is Dana. The AI name is Dan.   * My name's Dana. I saw that you're trying to process a refund.   * Let me know if you want me to just help you out over text. I'll walk you through how to do it.   * Well, I got pretty sweet idea. You got 30,000 tickets, 500 people organization. We can do a lot of cool things in here. We can help you save money by not having so many people. And oh, by the way, that one of the jobs of the customer success team is, whenever a ticket is closed successfully, they're supposed to turn around and go. Hey? Did we do a good job? Are we? Did we meet your expectations? And if they go. Yes, we did. Then they turn around and say, Hey, we have this referral program.   * If you introduce us to another restaurant that ends up using our pos system, we'll pay you a thousand bucks pretty sweet.   * Not only this helps the restaurant order make more money. It also helps the the business spot on. Make more money. I was like, All right, this is gonna be a banger. This is awesome, like we make more money or the spot on for the teams. We help people like answer their questions.   * What happened?   * What is your prediction? This went live? What? What do you think actually happened? Go ahead. Do you have an idea? No.   * okay.   * Anyone like a agent hallucinating a lot or like, no, we build our stuff really? Really? Well, okay, no hallucinations. It actually reads exactly what's in the documentation. It gives you the answers in a very, very detailed, thorough manner.   * What else?   * Injuries were kind of too complex for the agent to give straightforward answers.   * Not necessarily. We actually, we built this, actually, a team of agents, really interesting approach for building complex applications. We create these teams. One of the job of one of the agents is a simplify like there may be like 15 steps. The agent reads that and creates out of 15 steps, 4 steps   * like we can solve for that technique. What else?   * What do you think people were doing?   * No, no, we didn't have any malicious. We had. Some people get pissed off at it, and, like, you know, just yell at the AI agent. But no one actually acted maliciously. What else   * I want you guys to think through. What were people were doing? Pre AI,   * and what we attempted to do with AI, and what would have happened as a result of it like talking life.   * live voice. And then it was not possible to talk to your AI. Maybe if they   * let's try again, I think you guys can get this, like all of the support people felt like they were getting replaced.   * Trust me, the support people would love to be replaced. And I tell you this, John was talking about like, what are the things that we want? AI to do? No one in that support team is like delighted to get to work every day and be like you know what? Let me add, one more menu item today like that is not a thing that people think about. There's plenty of complex things for the support team to do. And, by the way, there's a huge turnover problem in that team as well. So this isn't like a we're not talking about like people are rejecting this, and people are like, Oh, my God\\! Like, Please, AI, do this shit. I don't want to do this anymore.   * I'll leave you guys on the customers, the restaurants   * when they picked up the phone or sent an email and saying, Hey, I need a menu to be changed. What they were getting in result was.   * the menu gets changed.   * They weren't getting an instruction manual from the customer support team like the customer support. Imagine you're on the phone like this. This is, I'm I'm on the phone with United, hey? I'm trying to change my ticket and the customer support rep or United goes. Well, yeah, I'll help you through that and go ahead. Log in   * click on the top right area. There's gonna be a drop down, menu. There, let me know what you do. I'll hold. Okay, I'm there. Yeah. When you're there, there's a on the 3rd left. There's a replace ticket button. Go ahead and click that. And now you have to go to your email, actually, like, grab the code and put it, Hello, change the fucking ticket.   * Want to know how to do it? You do it.   * I have a restaurant to run. This is what ended up happening. This thing started texting hundreds of people saying like, Hey do it\\! And half the people who wrote back said.   * I mean, I get it. But can't you just do it for me.   * Sometimes they sit at a not so nice place.   * This is what we thought that innovation was in this nice pathway and people cutting through.   * Why would anybody want to be shown how to do something when the when they're expected behaviors just do the damn thing for me. So now we're actually changing, because it's not obviously a bad idea. This thing knows how anything is done. Now we're actually building the the pipelines into the back end of their Api, and we picked 4 items in their customer success tickets, 15% of their tickets. So it's basically 4 things change my menu change the price on something. Add a new item to my menu. Add a new user like a staff member or something, and then process a refund.   * But these are the 4 things.   * So now we're building the back end that anytime you text this thing to say like, Hey, I I need you to process a refund. This thing just gets you the refund and says, Hey, I'll do it. Now, it's hard technical problem to do this. So this is what we're doing in between.   * Instead of saying, I'll show you how to do this. Now the AI responses, hey? I see that you're trying to process a refund. I just need like 3 more details from you. One of my team members is, gonna take care of this as soon as possible. If you just respond to this text, I just need a little bit more triage from you.   * This is sort of this incremental path to innovation at the end of the day. It doesn't matter that the AI is doing this, the customer output here is my shit gets done faster.   * This is what I want to share with you guys today.   * I love that we are using AI to achieve these business outcomes right now. And ultimately, what I believe 2 40 is gonna turn into. And right now, the. So if you see from the outside that we're in the agency, what we're building internally is basically a giant python. SDK,   * everything that we build for our customers goes into a library, a library that we're calling Geppetto, the maker of Pinocchio. Because it's ultimately down the road. We believe that the most   * sort of like entities that use our solution are going to be other AI agents themselves. So we're not spending time building an interface. We're just building more integrations, more, more capabilities and more sort of like complex tasks that an agent can take over and do down the road.   * Okay, that's what I had amazing things, awesome alright.   * And with that we're gonna move over now to Adam.   * Introduce him already. So no more introductions need to be done things right over to Adam.   * and then we'll bring them both back again in about 15 min. All right, Adam, over to you.   * ![Adam Tilton][image9]   * **Adam Tilton**   * 00:59:22   * Awesome. That was a ton of fun.   * Lot of good stuff in there that I can pick up on just a quick test to get started. Everybody can hear me. Okay, audio is good.   * ![John Renaldi][image10]   * **John Renaldi**   * 00:59:32   * Good.   * ![Adam Tilton][image11]   * **Adam Tilton**   * 00:59:33   * No, it's all right. Great.   * real, quick background engineer dropped out of my Phd. Program to start my 1st company rhythmia. That's when I met. John ran that in Chicago.   * through the lens that Mert wrote here we could talk a lot about how we did not effectively help make people money.   * We didn't help them save any money. We sort of helped them go faster, but not enough. That mattered, and we didn't remove any risks from their business. When we figured that out, we sold that business to Bosch Sensor Tech actually saw them at Ces recently. And that part's doing really well. An example of a technology innovation that just wasn't enough to be a business on its own.   * I did a couple of other startups after that before going out on my own again starting active. That was a quick business. We sold that one to Nike 9 months after we started that company, and then at Nike I worked for Nike innovation. Originally I was responsible for all of their connected product software. Nike was going to put a sensor in a shirt or a shoe, or whatever   * my responsibility was to make that happen. Everything from firmware, mobile sdks, back end data infrastructure.   * And then, later in my career at Nike, I ran software more broadly across the portfolio, reporting into the president of innovation at Nike.   * And I have a lot to share or could share about that. But I think what I want to do now is talk about what we're doing at Driver, and to reinforce some of the points that Mert made in his wonderful introduction. I'll tell it through the lens of some of these key ideas that he brought up.   * I have a car to sell you, but the airbags don't work. Does anybody want to buy it?   * No, no takers. So you want the airbags in your car to work, I presume. Is that right? Can I get a show of hands. For who's   * Who's a fan of airbags and cars? Does anybody know how an airbag works?   * Anybody ever tried to build an airbag system. I mean, it's kind of a miracle technology, right? You get in an accident and then milliseconds. It   * deploys itself and saves you from what could have been otherwise a fatal crash.   * Well, imagine that you're the team of individuals who have to deliver airbags to a consumer market right? And we all agree that airbags are extremely important. So there's a strong why behind, why, you would want an airbag to work saves lives.   * Now imagine that you have to build it   * the way that these products get assembled is through a long supply chain of suppliers. Somebody builds electronic components that goes to an oem manufacturer that builds an airbag module that goes to an automobile manufacturer that goes into an automobile that goes to a regulatory agency that regulates airbags to determine which markets it can be sold in, and then eventually you get to buy it. It's a long supply chain in order to build something like an airbag. And the same is true for   * basically, all of the things inside of the classroom that you're looking at right now, except for maybe some of the regulatory considerations. But there's a projector on the ceiling. That also has electronics components in it. You're all using laptops and other consumer electronics. You carry cell phones. You have maybe smart watches on   * a variety. Basically, everything in our lives that moves or shines. A light has some sort of electronics component inside of it.   * And the way that these teams operate with one another. The experience of trying to work with one of these complex embedded components is defined by technical documentation, and to give you an example, in the airbag case. It's a 30,000 page technical reference manual.   * It's for the oryx part which is sold by a company called Infineon, and the example code bases that they provide online is 96 million source lines of code. You could sit down as a software engineer and begin looking at 96 million source lines of code and not get through all of it. Having learned everything that there is to learn in a decade, it would just take you forever.   * The complexity of these products is outstanding, and the organizations that build the documentation that express how these products work and then develop the example applications to demonstrate how they're supposed to be used in products, spend millions of dollars every year, not to make the technology.   * but to explain to others how to integrate that technology into their products. And throughout my career, both at rhythmia, when I was doing embedded development and building that into electronics components. And then at Nike, when I was on the vendor component selection team and I was buying components to integrate into our consumer electronics problems   * the number of nights that I have lost to reference manuals and data sheets. I'll tell you an example. We bought a part when we were at Nike, a specific kind of imu.   * and we bought it so that we could measure when an athlete's foot was impacting the ground on the run, which is a very difficult thing to measure. And you need a special kind of accelerometer to do it.   * After we integrated this part into our product and spent 9 months trying to bring up that board, we discovered that our supplier had made a mistake inside of the part, and the very reason why we bought the part didn't work. They broke something in the hardware.   * You lose hundreds of thousands, if not millions of dollars, in many months in product development cycles. If these things aren't built the way that they're supposed to be built and effectively described to the audiences that are trying to buy them.   * It's a very technical business. It's something that all of these businesses do today and spend a lot of money on one of the things that Mert said. I'm not selling AI. I would add to that. I'm not selling AI, either. What I'm selling is Roi.   * I can help you do a job that you do today.   * I can save your business a substantial amount of money by automating the work that they do.   * and because you're a supplier who doesn't make money until your customers go to market, which means integrate your part, build a successful product and launch it. I can help you make more money by supporting more of those customers and shortening the amount of time that it takes for someone to integrate your product into their product and then sell that product to the market.   * It's a very exciting business and an incredibly difficult thing to go and build.   * So I'd like to talk through how we approach this. And one of the other things I was picking up on that Mert was talking about is the way that he sells value when he's in talking to the customer.   * We were on a call with   * multi-billion dollar in Revenue Semiconductor Company yesterday, and we were talking about the project that we're getting started on. And they were thinking about the opportunity to use driver for a couple of different use cases.   * and in that conversation we were expressing the opportunity for them to load their software in a driver, and will automatically produce all the technical documentation. We take them through a demo. We show them all of that.   * and they get excited about it. But that wasn't the 1st thing that we did on the call. We spent the 1st 15 min on the call, asking them, How do you do this today? What, specifically, are the things inside of your business that you're trying to accomplish. Who's the executive sponsor who is sponsoring this? And it turns out that what they're doing right now is running an evaluation process to decide which documentation platforms they want to use to accelerate this work. And the reason they're thinking about that is because they saw the driver AI platform. And so now, because they're a large company, they have to evaluate.   * And it turns out that they've already identified a couple of important business use cases.   * This is an important concept, especially when you're in a market like I'm in because it tells you how you're going to answer these questions that Merck brought up. What is a use case. It's something that a business does, an activity that they participate in.   * They have internal developers who write software. They could expose to sdks that they then give to their customers and their customers use them to build a product pretty straightforward.   * The way that they develop the technology internally is that they have these subject matter. Experts who are highly skilled engineers that are incredibly expensive   * write not just the software, but the documentation. And they spend 50% of their time writing that documentation. And so we say   * so why do you want driver? And they say, Well, we think it's going to reduce the amount of time that our Sme spent writing documentation and also enable us to have better documentation. That is accurate to what the software is doing because we're automatically producing it with the system. Great.   * Reduce the amount of time that you spend on something. Reduce the amount of risk of you putting documentation in a customer's hand that miss, that misdescribes what the technology does check check. What's the other use cases you have? Well, for all the SDK documentation that we put in the market. Sometimes the underlying software changes   * in a way that doesn't get updated in the documentation. So we end up with all sorts of different versions of software assets and all sorts of different versions of documentation, and often our customers will be looking at 2 things that don't align with one another. And then they call our customer support team.   * Well, what happens? In that case? Sometimes they're unsuccessful using our products, and we don't make the sale. Other times it just delays in our time to revenue shortens perfect.   * So if I automate your documentation process and I align that to the software that you're developing, then I'm able to satisfy both, reducing the amount of time that you spend internally, also helping you make money and reducing the risk of pissing off a customer check, use case number 2, and we go on like this the way. So I wanted to reinforce these points because Merck did such an excellent job of giving you an introduction to why a business exists, and what the important parts are that you have to satisfy. If you want to build a successful company.   * and this comes through in everything that you do, especially in a sales motion.   * How do you help save money? How do you help make money? Can you reduce risk? Can you make these teams go faster? And if you can do that, then you don't need to sell AI, because what you can sell instead is the Roi against these direct use cases, and a very clear way for your customers to evaluate your product against those use cases in that roi which will make them want to buy, because they see an opportunity to make more money, go faster, reduce risk, etc.   * and if you can do that for an operation that a business is already doing. That means that they already have dollars associated with that task. So you don't need to get them to invent new dollars to spend. All they can do is reappropriate, the money they were going to spend otherwise to buying your tool, which gives them a direct benefit.   * And the other thing that Mert said that I want to quickly reinforce is that people don't want to do this. This is not the kind of job where people come home at the end of the day, and they say I had such a wonderful day at the office. I wrote this amazing piece of documentation. No, they come home because they built a cool piece of technology that they're excited about. And that's what they want to do. So even better. If you can identify a use case, especially if you're doing b 2 b enterprise sales.   * something that people don't enjoy doing.   * Driver is a phenomenally exciting business. We're about 18 months in. We're building a huge enterprise based product that gets deeply integrated in with our customers a very different kind of approach. We have already a 16 person team. We've raised 8.5 million to date. We're going to raise a relatively large series A, and eventually the scale of this business could be enormous   * and the but I started with the why, and I want to bring it back to that, because you can get lost in our one of the employees who works for driver tells this joke. All the time. He says my mom was holding me   * when I was a baby in her arms, and she said, you're going to be the king of technical documentation.   * It's not the sexiest business for sure. But remember, we all want our airbags to work. We want our microwaves to work, and our ovens to work, and our refrigerators to work, and our cell phones to work all the things that have electronic components in them. We want them to work, and we want them to be less expensive and more accessible. We want to be able to maintain them when they're in the market. And it turns out that the way that you explain the technology and the technical documentation defines the customer's experience.   * If the customer is the person who's buying that product to go and build their own product. And so that's why we're excited about this business, because this underpins everything that exists that moves or has a flashing light on it.   * I wanted to keep my introduction pretty short, so that's most of what I have to say. I also will comment a little bit on how different it is to do innovation within a startup like what Mert and I are doing, and innovation within a large company like what Nike is doing, and I think just quickly, I'll try to describe what the differences are there   * as an entrepreneur. Before I ever started this company I had a why   * I had worked as an embedded engineer. I had bought components and then integrated those into products, and I was frustrated with my own personal experience.   * One of the key differences about doing innovation inside of a large entity like Nike   * is. It wasn't my why.   * it's Nike's. Why Nike has a very specific reason for existing as a business, and everything that they do, whether it's innovation, operations, etc, within the organization needs to be aligned to their why.   * And it's an important perspective to have, because, as you're doing, innovation inside of a large company, you may have an idea or something that you think is exciting, and you may discover that you have a why for why? You want to do this, and it's an important checkpoint to decide whether or not that why aligns with the why of the business, and as a result, is something that could be very successful, run inside of an innovation team inside of a large organization.   * Or if that, why doesn't align with that organization's why. In which case you may want to either drop that idea or consider moving on to something else, and that's part of what made it so frustrating for somebody like me to exist inside of an innovation team at Nike versus being on my own and running my own company.   * So not only do the ideas start with why, but also the way that you make an idea successful can very much be dependent on whether or not that why aligns with the organization that you're working with it?   * Alright, John, I wanted to add that quickly, in case we want to get into some differences between large organizational innovation and startup   * entrepreneurship, innovation.   * ![John Renaldi][image12]   * **John Renaldi**   * 01:12:30   * And we'll have a   * chat with both these gentlemen. I wanna talk a little bit, both of you guys, about the business.   * Because in both cases you guys aren't selling like a very like the pitch isn't buy my product. This stuff is, I'm selling you, Roi. I'm selling you this other thing. And so   * this idea of a willingness to pay comes in, especially if I have dedicated already budgeting in place. So   * I have a budget for this much stuff. I'm gonna spend and so   * maybe for this customer, the value isn't $200 a month, $300 a month, $500 a month for software which maybe I'd easily pay in a normal Saas model.   * Actually, if you're making me 20% more money you know, what's that worth to me? What's it worth for me to make 20% more revenue this year? What's it worth to me to cut my expenses by 30? 1st with with you. Talk a little bit about how you're how you had thought previously.   * maybe how you thinking now, and maybe where you see things going   * so pricing something is always a sort of a complex, as I believe pricing is a feature of the product that you're building like it's blue pig and how much it's price is sort of like a simpler decision   * you can do, obviously cost based pricing, which is how we were thinking about these things early on. It's gonna take us 6 months to build this thing. It's gonna cost us as much to set a healthy margin to it. We gotta be profitable. I'm a boot trap business. So profit really matters like very much operated a profit 1st basis.   * But if you imagine, like how these conversations are going.   * My customer don't give 2 shits about how much stuff costing like it's outside of their scope when somebody's trying to make a buy versus whatever decision or not to anything decision they're thinking about. Am I gonna get promoted because of this? Am I not gonna get fired because of this? And am I gonna help hit my Kpis as a result of this. So I always like to arm my customers. When I say, Hey, it's gonna cost you a hundred grand to do this, and you're welcome   * you're welcome, that I'm not charging you 200 for, because I'm gonna drive you a million dollars in value, and that very much goes into the contract like, here's a rationale that I'm putting it into my little purchase proposal for you, so that the Cfo. Was reading so ultimately can be a blocker of this goes, oh, my God\\! Like immediately approved like, let's go do this.   * This is especially useful when you're having to create a new budget line. Item. You know, we're in like net, new fields in in our customers conversations. They might not have an AI consulting budget sort of carved out for doing what we already knew. They might have a documentation budget which is awesome like, let's tap into that. We can do that 10 times better. But I ran into this problem. My 1st business. We were selling patient safety solutions to hospitals and hospitals had an abysmal, patient safety budget.   * Now, what we're experimenting with is basically almost risk sharing with our customers. And this is a little easier to do with our existing customers.   * I now know from one of my customers. We do them basically AI agents based cold outbound. So an AI agent researches the leads, writes a 1 on one email and reaches out to those folks. We charge them $40,000 for our 1st year   * they drove $700,000 in contract value from the emails that this damn thing wrote.   * I'm upping my price, and I'm like more tempted to say, like, Hey, actually, next year   * you're in luck. No subscription fee. I'll take half   * half of what we signed on your margins. I trust you. I think you're gonna do great next year.   * This is something that I'm entertaining right now, and I think the more and more we do these things, the more kind of this risk sharing becomes really, really feasible because my outcomes, I'm confident.   * So this idea of success based pricing is becoming more and more clear with AI companies. Because of exactly this, you're buying some type of outcome.   * This thing is not doing something that I haven't done before. It's doing the things I already do. But it's allowing me to do more of them, making me more money, allowing me to free up time to work on more by order, tasks, saving money, risk, speed. And so this idea of sharing in the success   * and the willingness to pay is starting to be refactor, which is why Merck's business, his margins won't look like a traditional consulting business. The traditional consulting business would be the cost basis. It'd be like, Okay, it's gonna take this much time.   * Our senior consultants charge out at this rate.   * etc, etc, etc. And so my blended margins for consulting business are like 60%.   * It's good 60%. Right? So now, if I go and look at a why-, why, our software companies and Sas business so attractive to venture capitalists.   * it's because not just the speed, but the margins are so frothy   * they're 90 plus points of margin business.   * and so it can't just be that you make a lot of top line. It can't be that you grow fast. It's got to be those things too, but it also has to be the potential of a high profit business. So from a unit economics basis, 90 plus points of margin plus. Well, this is interesting.   * because if you have success based pricing.   * you have a small team that can scale this company actually   * starts looking more like a software business. If I think about it in terms of its growth, its margin profile and ability to scale. And it doesn't look like a consultant.   * So these new business models. These new types of businesses are emerging that are that are blending these 2 things. It's unclear how the funding models come together because a Vc model is built on the fact that he is going to go, turn around in the shortest period of time   * and sell for the biggest multiple on revenue you can possibly get. That's the venture capitals playbook either get acquired for a huge multiple on revenue or Go IP   * and do that within 10 years, because I got to return this back to the fun, the fun, life\\! 10 years\\! That is their motivation.   * So Merck's business that he just described   * does that sound like a business that did like. If I describe that.   * does that sound like at the surface of Vc investable business?   * Not not like, not immediately, not immediately. And that's because of the terms by which they expect to be paid out. But if you take a step back from there.   * what they're really trying to say is, I need a higher than market average irr on my investment   * and a high return on invested capital.   * And the those other things are like the way in which they get that. But ultimately, that's what they're really trying to do.   * High, you know, a a 25% or greater irr on the investment. So double what the average can do in the public markets   * and make sure I do that. And in a very short period of time   * it's like effective right within 10 years.   * 10\\.   * That's that's their goal. So I wrote a different term   * to me. And I said, Okay, listen. I know you're not gonna sell your business.   * I know you're actually gonna be super profitable pretty quick.   * and not just like within one or 2 years, but like within 12 months. So if I can get you to profitability as fast as possible, and get you to scale as fast as possible with 90 plus points of margin.   * I still might be able to get my 25% Irr   * probably could do it a lot risky. So now, all of a sudden, he actually does start to seem like a bit of an easy investment, but not on the terms I'm used to investing.   * This is going to be a whole new model. No one's figured this out yet.   * It's happening as we speak, which is why I wanted to bring both of these founders in, because they're both playing in adjacent, but in similar places where they're selling this type of value that is already being done, but scaling that thing in such massive rates that you can imagine success based pricing   * being an insane way in which these companies can scale, because they can just give you that whole thing that you have an army of people already doing but doing way faster way. Better. So I'm gonna ask the same question around business model, Adam.   * how are you? How have you thought? How are you thinking today, and how you think it may move forward in the future for your business.   * ![Adam Tilton][image13]   * **Adam Tilton**   * 01:21:29   * Yeah, this is a I mean, as Mert said, try, pricing is definitely a part of the product.   * We don't talk about pricing on our website. In fact, we keep the amount of information that our potential customers can read on our website to the least amount possible to make them want to have a conversation with us.   * and the reason that we do that is to maintain our flexibility in the sales process because we run a process called value based sales. And   * there's a lot to that. We could spend quite a bit of time talking about how you run an effective value based enterprise sales playbook.   * But one of the key ingredients is maintaining your ability to price the product on an individual basis on an enterprise by enterprise basis.   * As the price. So we we've evaluated a number of different pricing models, and we've landed at a rather typical pricing model, even though we're doing things in AI and have the opportunity to do outcome based pricing. We've actually decided to stick to something that everybody is familiar with.   * We charge based on consumption.   * The total amount of technical assets that we consume and document. So we count the number of lines that we document, and we charge you for it.   * and we charge a per seat license. This is very similar to what Openai is doing. Chat Gpt is a per seat license. Their Api models are per use, consumption based model   * consumption based models are all over the place and have gained a lot of popularity.   * and the reason why we ultimately decided to stick to what is maybe a little bit more of a traditional business model   * is for 2 reasons, one being able to scale the business. We're negotiating a contract with a conglomerate that has 600,000 employees. They're in every business that you can imagine. They have a Home Comfort Division that builds Hvac stuff for your houses. Many of you probably have your appliances in your kitchen. You definitely have stuff that they build inside of your cars.   * They do pretty much everything, and as a result, when you work with a company like that, they need clear predictability into how working with you is going to scale across all of the different things that they do.   * They don't want any surprises. The Cfo is going to decide what the budget is for the engagement a year, sometimes multiple years ahead of time, and he doesn't want it to change. He wants there to be basically, however much we decide to use this in our organization. And if we can forecast that we know what it's going to charge. In some situations. It's actually not good to innovate on things like the the pricing model of the business model. You want to look.   * The best advice that I ever got is when you're walking through a supermarket, and you get to the place where you're about to buy something. There's a bunch of stuff there.   * Why, what happens in that moment?   * There's a thing that looks like something that somebody wants, and so they buy it, and they don't even think about it, and they move on in many situations. That's what you want to look like as a business looks like a duck talks like a duck. We buy it like a duck. It's a duck.   * You just want to be a duck.   * However, there are huge opportunities to drive massive Roi. If you can do value-based sales effectively. And if you're using tools like AI, what we decided is when we did the profit margin analysis, we were 99.8% profitable on many of the things that we were going to do.   * the opportunity for us to make money. It just didn't matter   * I don't care. My pricing is so high compared to what it's going to cost me to deliver this service to you, that if you want to pay me like this. Pay me like this. That looks good to me.   * The challenge that a lot of other AI businesses are running into is, that's not always the case, and this can change very quickly   * the cost per value within the generative AI space and the large language models can be orders of magnitude. Gpt. 3 is 10 x less expensive than Gpt. 4\\. 0, and didn't they just lose something? That's $200 a month that used to be $20 a month.   * Things are going to move very quickly. So the other thing that you have to be looking out for right now in such a dynamic environment is, you want to be able to maintain that flexibility. If we decide to launch a product feature with a more advanced   * model in the future that has different economics in order for us to be able to deliver it. We've kept our pricing model pretty straightforward and simple, adding in new features is something that we think that we'll have flexibility for down the road.   * So we're intentionally trying to not over complicate the way that we price to do it in a way that is extremely repeatable, and to maintain flexibility on an individual basis. As we're negotiating these deals.   * we could go on. I mean, there's so much to talk about in just this one category. But those are the things that are top of mind for me.   * ![John Renaldi][image14]   * **John Renaldi**   * 01:25:48   * Looking at our time. We're coming up at 22\\. So this is super rich conversations, super valuable stuff. I want to thank both Mark and Adam for joining us today.   * Talk to you again soon.   * Mark will be back here. He's got to run off for a call. He'll be back around 1130, or 40 for lunch, and so if you want to ask him a few questions there, he'll be available, and with that we'll let you guys take about a we haven't had too much of a break today. So let's go ahead and do like a 15 min break. Give you guys like plenty of time to sort of like. Just get your coffee relax, go to the bathroom, and then that'll give us a good amount of time for our class exercise to really come in with a fresh, fresh brain.   * All right. So we'll come back, let's say at 5, 10\\.   * ![Adam Tilton][image15]   * **Adam Tilton**   * 01:26:44   * Okay.   * See you all. Thank you.   * ![John Renaldi][image16]   * **John Renaldi**   * 01:27:52   * Jackets here.   * Yeah, yeah, okay, yeah. Okay.   * yeah, that's fine.   * So even though, you're not   * so wrong. Okay, 1st thing.   * big dolphins, cheap pizza.   * Okay, we're gonna go ahead and get started.   * Love, the energy of Martin and Adam bring in some really great energy into class. What takeaways, what kind of stuck out to you guys   * anything?   * Nothing. Come on. Latest simplicity of like the 4 jobs to solve. I think it makes it more digestible. But also like anchoring on. Okay, how are you thinking about your totally, I want to reinforce with that.   * Both of them are b 2 b businesses.   * So understand that those 4 things are true for B, 2 B businesses and absolutely untrue for consumer businesses. Consumers do not act rationally in their purchasing decisions. That's a very rational   * pine tree.   * Make me money, save me money, risk rational.   * It's just an act.   * Mostly Russia consumers.   * Do they think necessarily about that? Those 4 things, maybe, maybe, but mostly it's an emotional   * drop. Yeah, make me feel some.   * Don't actually think too much about it.   * I want you to feel something now. I still have to solve a big problem like like in order for me to feel something. It probably means it's got to be pretty important to me. So still got to align to a key problem that's in their life. So to do, a lot of the same 1st principles are the same. But those 4 things very true to B. 2 B. Not very true. What else   * it does get? The fucking room   * he's able to like rapidly speed up the incoming funnel. How would the rest of the business adjust. So now they're doing 10 x the number of business. How do they handle? So maybe let's say, he didn't solve the Rfi problem. Now they have a hundred.   * They now displace the other architecture firms in town when they   * gobble up their architects right? Because if imagine this, imagine, if you can act like that.   * I mean, it's not like people are building more buildings right? They're stealing from. They're winning more businesses. Their win rate went up, which means the win rate went down   * or something.   * So you can quickly see that the companies that incorporate these things are the companies that will remain.   * the companies that are slow will just do it.   * I mean, imagine now, a company, if you walked in, they had typewriters. No computer like those companies die.   * you don't see them. They don't exist. They did. They were there.   * They had typewriters, and then they got   * trying to buy the competition that adopted the next technology faster and more efficiently. This is just the cycle of of life. And now we're in like that next big phase shift.   * And the companies that that adopt these things will be the ones that we what else?   * That's a small thing, maybe not   * depending on how you want to have it. But it's like what you said that pricing?   * Yep, that's right. Very key pricing is not an afterthought   * word to it. We're going to explore this   * in much more depth in the business modeling class.   * There's a whole book that you'll be reading on this   * that we'll be talking just about   * something that I thought was really interesting was figuring out like your current use cases, what people are already doing like the 3rd path, like the desire paths. And how do you just pay those for people. It goes really back to the jobs like really nice way to tie those things together.   * I was surprised how aggressive he was with success based architecture.   * So he was like, it wasn't just like a 5% of your success. It's like, Oh, no. Take 50% of your success.   * And that clients were open to it. They're like, Oh, I'll take that. I don't know. It's fine. I mean, this is the idea of willingness to pay   * like it's your job to figure out how much money you're leaving on the table, or how much more you could have grown by pricing, pricing it to a lower entry point to make it digestible enough, because what happens in success based pricing is, he'll show up and say, you don't actually owe me anything up front. So imagine coming in to a conversation with a new client. Now the existing client also wins because they're like, I see, a ton of value.   * Right? So if I want you to spin up my next project   * right, I know, like you've shown me. I make more money or save more money. So like we have a really good conversation about what that's worked.   * At some point. In time it becomes a make or supply.   * just like everything else inside of a company.   * They'll do the same thing with software. Okay? Well, I know the software can make me more money. But if I got to pay every single year this much might I just be able to go off.   * hire some engineers and build that myself right now? The companies he's talking to do not have the expertise to do those things. Here's why?   * Because the people in the organization that have talent   * are likely on the core product.   * not the operation side, not the sales side, not the internal. They're they're working on the core part of the product of their business. That's where the highest talent is going and the people that likely have the skills to do things like this   * are working there.   * They also, those people do not love working on   * boring stuff like this. So yes, they may be able to redeploy   * the resources. But those resources may not actually want to do that.   * Second is the It. Teams that would normally be responsible for this are oftentimes not set up.   * have this type of thinking and or have the talent.   * And so this is an opportunity that exists today.   * Over time. Those skills will be   * over time that pricing will not be able to remain, because a Cfo will come and say, Wait a second.   * So   * now I understand you're making 50% more sales, 2 x more, 10 x more. But eventually some point in time that becomes the new norm. And I forgot all about how we actually got there. And that's the new normal. So now, okay, snapshot baseline.   * Where's this 50% going? This looks a whole lot like an expense we can.   * I don't think about that when everything's going up into the right. But when things start to shore sort of settle in, and that becomes the new normal. Now, all of a sudden, he's gonna have price erosion   * now, and his job is to make it such that it's just not worth it. It's not worth for me to do the risk like it's not worth for me to go build it internally, because I'm like, maybe I don't get it right. Maybe it takes me more time like it's just easier to go here, and his job is to detect when those price erosion need to happen, so that the Cfo or the new leader, or whomever doesn't look at this and be like, Hey, couldn't we just build this ourselves? It should be like, yeah, we could.   * But let's apply our like. We we can do more valuable things than this with our own team.   * But at 50% mark, you know, at 50%, they might quickly say, no, that actually, it's a pretty big thing at a certain scale.   * So really interesting model.   * I would say. You know, there are others. That's not, you know, unique to him. If you look Zendesk is doing the same thing. Seen Zendesk pricing for their AI agents they charge by successfully closed ticket. So if the AI agent was able to respond and close out that ticket satisfactory at a high csat with that customer.   * you pay them if it didn't, you do not.   * And so with that model, like, all right, like what's for me as a business sort of like, that's not a lot of risk for me to like sort out like, okay, if it works, it helps me out. I'll pay you same thing with Mert. He goes in and says, Listen, I'll come in the front door. You don't gotta pay me anything like I only win if you win.   * And then I'm incentivized to keep on making that thing better. So I don't just like ship it to you and walk away like a consult. That's why like this model is different, right? He just doesn't go in and build something to them like, there you go, like Accenture or Deloitte would, or whomever like we're done now with our systems integration work and consulting.   * He, he's incentivized, continue to innovate and make that product better, because the more he can make that money or save even more, the more he makes.   * So the alignment incentives are super interesting.   * Okay, class exercise. Get into your teams. And we're gonna go back to this idea that we mentioned about   * thinking about your competitors or an industry. We're thinking about the legacy   * companies that play in a particular industry pick. It doesn't matter like pick your industry be a line, your capstone. It should be something that is interesting to you could be totally freshman doesn't matter. Pick an industry, think about a particular problem that these types of companies or this type of industry could have or an opportunity space within that. And then think about how the big companies   * would likely go about attacking those problems. If they were to go do it, they'd probably approach it. This.   * And when you do that, have to think of like, okay, that means that they're not doing it this way. And so what would that open? What would the potential opportunity for a new entrant be? Because the legacy. Folks would probably solve this problem in this way.   * An example like we said before, would be like Boeing if Boeing were to innovate and make you know.   * rockets or whatever like that. Better rockets, how how would they? Oh, we got to get more government contracts. We got to like lobby more. We gotta do like this like they wouldn't have thought about reusable like they would have gone about it this way. And why wouldn't every usable components been useful? Because it would have risked like these other lines of their business, or whatever it was. The innovators dilemma concept where like, they don't want to disrupt themselves. So do that. Get together. We'll share out   * through that lens of like figuring out. What are those opportunity spaces from? From the legacy? Alright. So get together, and we'll come back   * right at 1130\\. Just do a very quick shot.   * Yeah.   * because   * oh, this is so young   * and I do it.   * That's like.   * oh, and, by the way.   * internal regulatory.   * it's a good   * yeah.   * okay, while you're thinking about this, I'm gonna introduce something else and how they go about their businesses. So this is like an example of saying, I've got an idea for doing music and movies on the Internet.   * right? That's like my, this is what I think is the opportunity space for my product. And so I start mapping out sort of how these other people do business. This can be used for you. As you guys think through your capstone, use this as a tool to inspire you to think about your competition, and how they would go about your business   * helps. You understand the openings, the areas in which you can attack   * also very helpful for you to show, as you were to pitch your masterful understanding of how the industry works.   * It's a tool. As much for that as it is for opportunity assessment. It just helps you think, through this is how the industry works and helps you rationalize sort of so quick tool for you as you're thinking through this. Continue, you got 5 more minutes.   * but that's too bad.   * Wants to volunteer.   * Hello, fresh, yeah. And how like, what kind of   * you can attack them? That and our team was.   * But we're not.   * But a certain step would come over   * based around like license properties like that'd be like.   * like, you can buy meal, Kit, or you could cook what they make. And why wouldn't they? Why wouldn't they do that? So we decided they wouldn't do that because,   * our idea would be a something that would be offered so it'd be. Maybe we only make 25,   * and it's not a a subscription model   * which held fresh is fully dependent on their supply chain. Yep, yep, so you're coming out of a different business model. It'd be very difficult for them to pivot to that other type of business model for fear of it, potentially cannibalizing great. All right. Next   * one more we did a wearable device for like medical insurance companies. So basically, the more you work out the lower your premium gets.   * And why wouldn't current folks, you know, do something like this with the current players?   * Welcome, really high startup cost for them to work in and integrate when they're already.   * I'd say, and that one. Their margins are typically hardware. And so they're like, that's the type of business model they understand. And oftentimes their partners. I'll give you an example of this one of   * when we were building the Moto maker product   * working in a hardware company. We would make money from selling hardware, and the reason why there was a lot of hesitancy for me to move to a services business. But it put threat to our Channel customers which were the cell phone carriers to them. They bought our product and they made the margin on service. So don't compete with me. I'm doing this. This is my\\! This is my sandbox. Don't play in my sandbox.   * You're you're making your supplier competing with me. And so we had to create a separate business   * to go compete on services with them, and we actually ended up becoming a reseller of their services by being a separate entity outside of the main company that could essentially then compete with our customers or partner with our customers. However, which way you'd want to see it.   * I would say, partner, they would maybe say compete   * so also think about as you do. These things like these companies, while at the surface like, may not be able to compete with you. They oftentimes can do these intelligent like, spin off a business unit and like, put them as a bar or partner with like   * you know, there's a. There's some of the consulting companies. Boston consulting is doing this where they will come in with their customers. They'll put like 5 of their team members in a brand new entity, along with like 5 handpicked people from the legacy business into a whole new business, and give those people like 60% ownership of it.   * And so it's like, if you're working at a big company. It's a way for me to kind of like sort of work at a startup now. So like I'm continuing getting paid my like salary from the main business. But if this thing does well, me and the people here are making like, we got 60% ownership. So we like incentive really aligned to go off and innovate. And because kind of at an arm's length.   * the main business can kind of. Oh, that's this other thing over here, like there's a firewall between us like, don't worry, customer. Don't worry. This like. Don't worry about like   * abiding by your own processes. You guys go over here and do your own thing. You don't. You're not constrained by like our internal operations. And so this model of innovation, of being able to kind of spin out a separate entity.   * As you think about larger organizations. It's a tactic they can take. So think about like. Why wouldn't they do that? That's another way. Or maybe, if you're thinking from a larger company, how could you   * do that as a way to compete and build out our horizon 3 or 4 to go after a market. That might seem something too disruptive to the main franchise business. All right. With that we're at time. Go have lunch and we will see you guys next week for our last. Oh, my gosh\\! Last class\\!   * Sorry you're kidding me for another 10 weeks after that. All right, guys.   * Oh, okay.   * There was someone that email me about the like, open sourcing the work on for the agent stuff. So I didn't get back to you because I was thinking about.",

Can you guys hear us.   * ![Christine and Josh][image2]   * **Christine and Josh**   * 00:00:46   * Yep can hear you.   * ![John Renaldi][image3]   * **John Renaldi**   * 00:00:49   * That Christine.   * ![Christine and Josh][image4]   * **Christine and Josh**   * 00:00:52   * Yes, and Josh is here too.   * Hey, everyone.   * ![John Renaldi][image5]   * **John Renaldi**   * 00:00:57   * Guys. However.   * Oh, no, that's me.   * ![Christine and Josh][image6]   * **Christine and Josh**   * 00:01:03   * Can you hear? Can you hear us.   * ![John Renaldi][image7]   * **John Renaldi**   * 00:01:05   * Can hear. You can't see you.   * ![Christine and Josh][image8]   * **Christine and Josh**   * 00:01:07   * I think, perfect. Oh, do you want to see us? Okay, that's fine.   * ![John Renaldi][image9]   * **John Renaldi**   * 00:01:10   * Now we do it.   * Is it possible to get like faces on there? So when people talk, yeah, I can do a gallery view.   * All right, we're gonna go ahead and get started. So today's discussion is gonna be a bit of a continuation of actually module 3 which was innovation inside the enterprise. This is really the focus more around change management. So this was a discussion that was brought up, I think, on day one of trying to bring in some additional insights around change management. And the theme here is really disrupting a bit.   * So how do you bring about change within an organization where you may not be the leader that has authority. So this is very much a discussion around leadership through influence versus authority.   * And most of today's conversation is going to be really through that lens.   * We do have another guest speaker. Today. Majar is our guest speaker. He comes from Google as a vice President engineering. And he's going to be talking to us about how to bring about how he brought about innovation within such a large organization as Google. So you can hear some of the things that we talk about as it relates to change management and how he practiced those and did those within an organization.   * So that's today's conversation and what we'll be chatting about in terms of our breakdown for today. We will end a little early today to give you guys some time to chat, all of us to chat about your final assignment.   * If there's any questions check in with where you're at. We'll have just a few minutes prior to class. So we can talk about that   * and then we'll have a nice class assignment, not assignment, but discussion and activity in the in the last 3, rd after we chat.   * our 1st break will be after our next. We'll give you guys a nice 20 min break.   * This is really breakthrough.   * Reflecting a little bit from last week. So last week we focused   * on innovation within the context of a much smaller organization   * Startup. We had 2 great guest speakers.   * We heard a little bit more around innovation through the lens of B, 2 B. So the 4 things that are looking to be done when you're building a product selling into the enterprise or b 2 b customer. It's save money.   * What else?   * More money save time.   * ![Christine and Josh][image10]   * **Christine and Josh**   * 00:04:15   * Reduce risk.   * ![John Renaldi][image11]   * **John Renaldi**   * 00:04:17   * Reduce risk. Those are the 4   * are those the same as consumer businesses   * MoD will talk more about consumer businesses today. So you'll get a little bit more insight around disruption and innovation for consumer focused business.   * But those 4 are very true statements for for the enterprise.   * Sorry, my.   * we talked about also the need for constraints within a small organization.   * and how those constraints really bring about innovation.   * One of the the more relevant salient examples of that is deep sea   * on how they had constraints, and they thought about solving those problems in a slightly different way than others.   * We also talked so, you know, and we've used different frameworks to think about this. But I think the the key here is, as you think about your capstone. You guys worked on this a little bit, the end of class. But thinking through, how would your competition solve this problem   * and mapping that out to find those areas of where you can attack.   * So it's not just how you would solve the problem and identifying those opportunities, but having to think about how your competition would solve that same problem. Should they enter into the market.   * And when you do that, it will start to have you think about those areas of differentiation.   * And I think   * this graphic was a really interesting one for you guys to really think hard about is as you think about that target market thinking through. Not just the problem you're solving. But think about how you bring it to market   * and making sure that those things are aligned and focused as you bring your product into market. And as you think about your capstone   * this is often something that is thought way too late in the game and product development is how we bring it to market.   * This was emphasized in the discussion with Mac around working backwards, starting with the Pr FAQ. This is a similar concept here thinking about how you bring it to market as you're designing the product.   * Thinking about that buying behavior, thinking about go to market as you're building the product as you're testing the product. As you're talking to your customers, you're uncovering their buying habits, you're uncovering their thinking about how they buy a product, how they buy your type of product, their behavior. You're not just trying to find out their problems around your particular solution. You're trying to figure out other aspects of how they would go about purchasing   * 2 great guest speakers, as we mentioned. Both had really great backgrounds and perspectives   * from besides those 4 things, what else stood out to you guys about the discussion with Mert and with Adam.   * what's that? Your big takeaway from those discussions?   * Think of this model?   * Yeah, interesting business models. Right? This new idea of emerging business models with AI success based pricing really interesting. Not so much with that. I mean, we're traditional. But with Mert this idea of success based pricing. So if you think about your capstones, we're going to be talking more about this in our next class, in our business modeling class. We're going to go really deep into this.   * but start already thinking about your business model and thinking about   * how are you going to charge, how are you gonna extract value for your business, for your product?   * Is there a way to bring in an innovative business?   * So we talked about the 10 types of innovation. One of those is the profit model, the business model that can be an area of innovation. Why would that be interesting? Because if someone like Merck comes into a client says, actually, you don't owe me anything for this software.   * You don't have to pay me anything. Normal consultancy would come in. Scope it all out $50,000 for like an evaluation phase, and then $200,000 for the implementation, and then 300,000 for maintenance and all this other stuff. He's coming in and saying, Listen.   * you don't have to give me a damn thing.   * You only pay me.   * That's a comp, that is not necessarily different. Pro product. Oh, well, he's ob- obviously building something different, but that by itself   * it's an innovative business that can displace his competition.   * Okay, as we get into today's discussion, I want to rewind the clock.   * Who remembers this company.   * Justin? All right. Friday nights. What what did you do? Describe to anybody what, actually, who hasn't ever been into a block.   * Justin, explain to us what it was like walking into a blockbuster video store in Circa 1997,   * we would.   * You're watching the videos for the renovances.   * Which means   * this point. It's Vhs tapes. How many of you even know what that is started with Vhs tapes. Yeah, not Betamax. Usually pick out one new release. Pick out one catalog release that we've seen a thousand times and only bust a dollar, and what would be on the walls? Literally a wall of Vhs tapes. Yes, so you would walk in, and the new releases would be along the outside perimeter walls right of the store.   * And I mean, you're talking like something from here.   * The end of that wall would be like one.   * and it would be filled like 3 to 6 rows of Vhs tapes that were there that you take off the wall and you bring up, and you rent. And that was the way in which you watched movies   * and blockbuster was the place to go across the United States.   * If you wanted to go rentally.   * eventually moved to Dvds same concept.   * And they crushed it over 9,000 stores all through the United States.   * What's happening around 1997, Internet's coming out.   * Yup.   * But also   * this company starts. Remember, when I said, like the most successful companies often have, like a 6, like one common theme, where the founders are just pissed off, and it's like vengeance like this is why Netflix was started. They're pissed off late.   * and so they build a mail order version of blockbuster. So you're not hit with these surprise. Late fees, because that's the other thing   * about blockbuster.   * It wasn't just a huge selection in the massive wall of titles for everyone that can remember back to them.   * I remember the length I didn't get this back.   * You could only rent them for like sometimes one day, 2 days, and they would tell you right on there, like how long your rental was like. The new releases were really short, like, maybe a day or 2, right?   * The medium releases right? Maybe 3 or 4\\. And like the really old stuff was maybe like a week or something like that.   * You had to bring it back on time, and you had to rewind it.   * Be kind, rewind.   * So you had to do all this shit right, all this extra process stuff.   * So when Dvds came out. Obviously you didn't have to rewind it. But the late fees still held, and Netflix says, you know what our original premise is just to get rid of the late fees. That's it.   * We're gonna do mail order. DVD catalog. You go ahead and get this. But, as you guys said, right about the same time that Netflix comes out   * the Internet.   * But it's the earlier   * we're talking 1998\\. What do you think bandwidth was like in 1998 for most Americans, what did it sound like? 14? Yes. And if you picked up the phone and someone was on the Internet, what would happen? It could make a call to drop the Internet. For, like your other relative that was using the Internet, right?   * Not gonna work for streaming videos in 1998,   * yeah, sure universities and a small number of Americans could, but this was still pretty far away.   * So it made sense that Netflix starts with Dvds. Matter of fact, they didn't think about streaming   * best part of it.   * Blockbuster   * had its blinders on when asked what they thought about Redbox, which also came out shortly thereafter, and Netflix, these emerging business models, potential competitors.   * They said, what these guys are niche players.   * We don't even think of them as competition, unbelievable.   * Blockbuster had a chance to buy Netflix for 50 million dollars.   * even in adjusted dollars. That's a steal right?   * They're blinders on Netflix, on the other hand.   * started to invest, even though the sound of the Internet was.   * They were skating to where the Puck was going.   * They weren't problem solving.   * They're problem one preventing. They were moving in the future. They're thinking about what's coming next   * and saying, well, if someone goes off and builds a streaming solution.   * what's that gonna do to my mail order, it's gonna completely destroy it.   * So I might as well get ahead of it and destroy my own business. I might as well disrupt myself.   * That sounds an awful lot. Also like Google right now with their investments in AI.   * It wasn't too long ago, within that company   * that AI was thought of potentially as a way to disrupt search which it is, but they invested in   * knowing that that would be the future, and if they didn't do it, someone else was.   * Netflix saw that change invested.   * But they started investing in the late nineties   * wasn't a service that was successful for another 5 plus years.   * Does anyone remember the very earliest Netflix stream.   * That's what do you remember?   * Very slow and just not.   * I mean, the quality was terrible. Quality was terrible. They didn't have any new releases. So the licensing deals that they had. You had to still order the Dvds. If you wanted to get the new stuff. The catalog that they could only offer was like the old shit. So it was often things that you'd play for like your kid, if you had kids at the time. Your kids you had like hours that were limited as well based on what tier of Dvds subscription   * have a great product in the beginning a product at all.   * But they kept on investing, and of course that paid off.   * If you don't do this, you end up.   * If you invest and try to constantly look, disrupt yourself. You end up like   * this idea of stagnation.   * It's not just going to destroy your business ultimately, but your employees are going to see   * Josh is joining us in the back. Josh is a professor that you guys all know, with Jim, Josh and I worked together at Motorola for a decade.   * Josh.   * talk a little bit about Motorola through this lens of stagnation, and what the employees felt, especially as it relates to how they went to market through carriers.   * And how do the employees feel about that.   * It's a good question, John.   * I can't say is that there was a moment that Motorola had made a sprint.   * Where the senior leadership team said, we've got some great products. In fact, we've got a winning product.   * But what we'd like to do is to be the number one mobile handset manufacturer in the world. In 100 days   * they will do. We will do anything we can to become number one in a hundred days.   * Still too fast. Nokia was the number one handset manufacturer at the time.   * And we did anything we partnered with anybody.   * Carriers, a little company called Apple play anything we want to come up. Maybe we could figure out a way to take the ipod and put it in our phone.   * So we taught Apple how to make phones.   * We went to at and T. And sold razors for like a dollar.   * anything to get market share out there.   * Meanwhile Apple was investing motor role was not invested in the same way.   * Apple built touch screens. We had touch screens.   * Great but we said, no one's gonna want to touch screen. They're all stylus based.   * We couldn't. Do, you know, assistive touch, not capacity, touch all these kinds of things.   * Then Apple came out with the iphone. We said, no one's gonna want it, like I think Apple got the carriers to pay them   * to sell their phone, whereas we gave carriers incentives to carry our phones.   * It was not a winning business model.   * Yeah. So Motorola had the ingredients. They had a smartphone operating system.   * They had an entire team in Sunnyvale, and if you remember, I mentioned this in the earlier class that was building a smartphone platform on the Linux operating system using Java.   * It's exactly what Android is, but they were doing it like 7 years earlier, 7 years earlier.   * they had touch screens. They were shipping touch screens in Asia.   * but they stopped. All of it   * need to redeployed. All of those teams   * try to be number one market share in a thousand days.   * What do you think all those folks in Sunnyvale that they stick around.   * Your employees know this stuff right?   * You work at a company, and you're stagnating leadership kind of sometimes last people to know the employees do.   * and that stagnation will immediately lead to that loss of talent.   * So if you want to maintain that talent, you're going to have to   * continue to try to disrupt yourself.   * and there's different ways to do this. We've talked about a number of these through our guest speakers. We've seen structural organizations where   * certain types of innovations are in a different team.   * We've seen some of them where they're embedded within the team.   * but they all have that phase separation that's talked about in moonshots around dedicated capacity and the need   * to integrate back into the franchise business. The transfer of this from the artists   * to the soldiers and the soldiers to the artists.   * thinking back to our example early on in the 1st day of class around the invention of radar   * that wasn't successful until that team   * put their scientists and researchers in the cockpit with pilots to understand how to integrate it. Early days of custom, discovery, and user experience, design, discovery of how to make it simpler to operate within the plane, but that integration   * was critical to its adoption.   * So as we think about change management, and you look at maybe an organization that you're within   * many times. It's difficult to think how you.   * you, you, as a junior member of that team, can change the trajectory of a large organization.   * But you can, you can start within what is inside of your control.   * And the 3 sort of general phases of change management   * are building a climate for that. We're gonna break down these these themes. But this is gonna be the the discussion for most of this morning.   * next half an hour, engaging the organization and then sustaining that change and building upon it   * in that 1st phase.   * As we think about how we bring about this, the 1st step is around creating some sense   * of impending doom.   * You have to shake people, create urgency   * that can be done through stories that can be done through narrative that can be done through sharing information that can be done through a number of different ways. Lots of different tactics. They all ladder up to creating a sense of urgency.   * I'm going to walk you through each of the 8 steps of change management through my example   * of when I implemented a product and a new business at Motorola   * that brought about massive change to the organization changed. How we sold devices\\!   * It changed, how we made money.   * and it changed ultimately how we got closer to our end users   * the day. The time was right after Google had acquired. And I mentioned this story. It's called Moto Maker   * Lior, and I build that business together, and the urgency   * was, we just got acquired by Google.   * and they want to see something for it.   * or they'll probably just shutter this fucking.   * If we don't do something, we will all be out of a job.   * That was the earnings.   * We can't just go about the status quo. We can't just make more razors   * building Android phones isn't not isn't enough.   * We've got to do something more than this.   * We weren't acquired by Google just to continue doing what we were doing. And if we don't do it   * all, we have pretty compelling reason   * very much around communicating the threats, but also the opportunity.   * Lots of what ifs?   * What if we could get closer to our customers at that time.   * Motorola. Remember back to what I mentioned Motorola, so their devices through carriers at and T. Verizon T-mobile, very much like they do today. But what you may not know about that industry is, they were the ones that actually created the specifications for the devices   * they would put out requirements to the manufacturer, saying, Make me a phone that does this.   * There'd be some negotiation. Of course, Motorola would bring in its design groups and innovation groups, and we would try to influence that. But they would literally put all the manufacturers up. And they kind of be like, I want that one. I want this one.   * this one I want you to change that.   * These were these were almost all devices that were especially made just for that carrier.   * You didn't build a device and then ship it out to all the carriers like you see today, there wasn't like a Samsung Galaxy S. Whatever, and every carrier had it.   * Samsung would make one type of model for at and T. And make a totally different model for Verizon.   * It might have some things that were close to similar. But it was a completely different device. Different software, different hardware.   * The reason why was the carriers were obsessed around exclusivity.   * I want to steal a customer from Team Mobile to come to Verizon way. I'm gonna do that, then offer you this thing that you only get.   * That was their main way of differentiation.   * Now they try to differentiate with services, too.   * in the early days of 3 G.   * At and T had a video share video calling service   * that they were trying to integrate. And so all the phone manufacturers had to have little front. We're facing cameras, certain types of specs so that they could do video calling on their flip.   * And that was a service that you pay.   * It was also because, like the Cdma and Gsm technology, because there were different technologies as well. That contributed absolutely so there were different network technologies across the various carriers in the United States. So, as Rishi said, you had Verizon and sprint on a technology called Cdma.   * and you had at and T and T-mobile   * Tdma, and then Gsm technologies. So there was a certainly an underlying component   * physical design was actually different, too. So the software is different, the network technology. But if even if the network technology was the same, so T-mobile and both had Gsm, 2 different phones.   * 2 different pieces of software. That was the world. And so when when Google acquired Motorola, it was.   * how do we get the carrier out of this? How do we focus on our end user? This is a crazy thing to think about.   * But there's still many times in many business, many entrepreneurs I speak with.   * where they're only listening to the person that's buying.   * Think about that, like some of the businesses that you may think about.   * They talk to the purse, the buyer, not the user.   * I'm gonna take all the feedback from the procurement team. I'm gonna take all my feedback from the executive.   * because they're the ones that hold the person. No doubt   * we certainly want to listen to them.   * But if we're not talking to our end users and the people that actually use the product on a day to day basis.   * We're missing out on, really where the market should take.   * And so this wasn't something that we could really do at Motorola. We could have focus groups and things like this.   * no analytics in our devices that could tell us how they were used.   * We had no idea, because the carriers controlled the software and precluded us from having any instrumentation of how users were using our devices in the field   * unbelievable.   * That's the world that we were living in. So the simple idea of what if we could just simply   * understand how our devices are being used. Would that be amazing? Just that one thing.   * How could we get closer to our users? So that was the prompt.   * How can we get closer to our users to understand them and develop products that innovate   * because Apple didn't have that same problem.   * Now, we could get into all sorts of   * lawsuits that probably should have been filed because the carriers let Apple do that and didn't let anyone else do it. But that was the world. So that was the prompt that we have.   * And so, communicating this widely creating the sense of urgency was table stakes to even start a discussion of them.   * So this gets back all to the Golden Circle. 5\\. Whys creating the why understanding this? This is where we start   * creating that sense of urgency.   * The next step is building a coalition of the willing.   * This is something that if you've been at a company for a longer time, becomes a little bit more natural.   * But even if you're coming into an organization new. It's something you should be doing from day one is starting to spread your network outside of your team.   * And the best way to do this is simply invite someone for coffee   * and ask them a ton of questions. Make it about them.   * When I joined at Motorola I would just   * meet with people all the time. That's how I met Josh.   * I wasn't a designer. I was in the technical marketing group, but I started having conversations with individuals across the entire organization, just learning about their their workflow, what they did, their challenges, what they're up to   * and building rapport across the entire organization.   * even more so with them than even within my team.   * And so, as you think about how to bring about change.   * the second step is around building that coalition. So when we started to think through the motor maker product before you even had solution in mind.   * we started with building up a prompt getting people motivated around. There's got to be urgency about doing something, bringing action. The second step was identifying a bunch of individuals of like minds that wanted to do something about it in a novel way.   * And so I would meet with lots of different people getting their ideas. How could we do this?   * What are you working on and pretty quickly figured out. There was a small group   * within the company that was working on customizable components.   * the ability to manufacture smartphone in modularity terms, allowing potentially the ability for us to build a customizable platform. So the small group of engineers working on this small group of designers.   * it's very early but started to bring them into the fold and recruit. This is like a Skunk Works project. No one told us to do it.   * No one gave us budget approval.   * But I started to bring all of those people together.   * and then start to think through. What are all the other teams that would need to be involved to make this successful.   * So I went out and recruited someone from finance. I went out and recruited someone from supply chain. I went and recruited someone from our factory team started to kind of build my coalition of the willing. Again.   * we're not asking for any permissions. We're just doing this as Google calls a 20% project. We didn't have that term.   * Find your coalition of the.   * and then start to communicate your vision for what it's going to be and be bold. Be audacious.   * Talk about where this is going to go over the next 5 years, and then bring it back down and walk them through it. How you go from here to there and talk through all the steps by which we're going to do it, not just the product and the technology, but going back to the 10 types of innovation. This is how we're going to bring it to market.   * Here's an idea about how we sell it. Here's an idea about the ad, here's a press release for what it looks like when we're successful. So we went up and created a video ad of what this would look like when we actually sold it started with an ad   * started with prototypes of what this is gonna look like when you came to the website   * making it very inspiring, very ambitious building that excitement   * communicating that vision over and over to all the team members, everyone, you start a meeting.   * So now, all of a sudden people are starting to see where the where this could go.   * So step 3\\. Vision.   * Okay. So at this point in time, now, we just start really   * doing the work. Because up until this point we're just sort of, I'd say, setting the stage setting the table. Now, we gotta start making the dinner.   * So step 4 is now starting. How do we communicate that vision? What is the like? Tactical ways in which you can do it? Which I did it.   * There's lots of ways, and the key here is, and there's no one way it's hitting every single channel you possibly can. It's I think Mike walked you through a bunch of tactics of innovation like lunch and learns workshops. Like   * all of them, we did   * town halls, emails videos. I mean, you name it. It was like hitting every possible communication channel through the whole company anytime we could hit somebody, because I don't know where we need to hit somebody where their attention is, and so we would try to hit them everywhere.   * I'd also be meeting with people all the time talking about who calls it.   * I want this, there will always be the naysayers, no matter what.   * There's going to be people in your organization that think this is too audacious.   * Oh, here we go this guy again in left field. There's always the negative. Nancy's. They're always gonna be there. Engage with them, find those people.   * and engage with them right away.   * Don't let them frustrate with you, but engage immediately and ask them to pull.   * How is this going to be?   * Don't have the presumptive positive that will be successful. Don't sell them. They don't want to be sold. They've already told you they don't want to be sold. They're telling you you're a joker. You telling them about how amazing it's going to be is not going to change their point of view on that.   * So be honest, be humble, and engage the naysayers. In this communication.   * Matter of fact, I probably spent more time with the naysayers than I did the believers.   * I'd suggest you probably spend 60 70% of your time engaging with the people that are adamantly against.   * Okay. So now I've gotten some momentum.   * I had to get a champion, Leo.   * So I had to start with one, find one executive help be my champion.   * I'm trying to convince a lot.   * Leo was the only person that really bought, so lior bought in   * help me with this as my champion within the organization within the senior leadership team.   * So going back to some earlier concepts that we talked about finding your champion once I had him.   * We also needed to then create some space for the innovation.   * So we went to our leadership team and we said, listen. Our company right now is structured in silos, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, software, engineering design.   * We need to take all of these people and put them into a virtual team and siphon them away from everybody.   * They can stay within their function. They'll still report into the head of design.   * We're gonna put them into a separate area of the building   * dedicated capacity, not gonna work on anything else. They're only gonna be working on this project.   * So we identified about 100 to 200 people across the company.   * they'd be taken from their current   * kind of reporting structures be brought into more of a hybrid or matrix style reporting tree, but dedicated capacity   * siphoned off from the rest.   * We wanted to create a space for our artists.   * Now it was key about that group of people.   * but these were not a bunch of people from outside the company. This wasn't like the innovation group   * that we're gonna go hire that sat outside in a different building. No, we. We're inside the current buildings, but a separate area within that is staffed entirely from people that had been at the company for probably at least 10\\.   * I can't think of anyone that was in that team that hadn't been already in the company that was on purpose.   * because once I build those people as my lieutenants and my next level believers.   * They went out and did the same thing to everybody else. They were my evangelizers that went out within their respective organization. So they went to their team meetings inside the supply chain, or they were the ones that were selling, talking, engaging about this new business.   * They were hearing it from the people they had trusted. They've worked with for years and years and years. They didn't hear it from the product guy they heard it from. In the language of their own team   * we encourage experimentation. Yes, I was responsible.   * but we let all of the leads make their own decisions as it related to this project. I was focused on the why they were focused on the How.   * So number of different innovations had to happen inside the factory. Lots of different innovations had to happen. In our supply chain were lots of different innovations, mechanical and electrical engineering teams, software engineering teams.   * We made them the responsible parties for those pieces, and gave them the flexibility, the space and ultimate decision making authority for those pieces, turning them into   * like rabbit rabbit owners of this solution.   * Now within a startup, this is especially important. But even in a larger work, this idea of momentum management.   * it's something that I didn't fully appreciate when I started my company.   * of being able to keep the pace up.   * because if you start to lag.   * things start slowing down and people start second. Yes.   * they're like, oh, I haven't heard too much about that project must not be going to our initial inclinations. We don't hear about something in a while. We think it must be going off the rails.   * So those naysayers are like whoop\\!   * All right, this thing is taking. They're actually rooting for your failure time to field.   * So this idea of keeping the momentum up keeping the communication up, keeping things moving.   * and this is done through a couple of different tactics. The 1st is show. Don't tell.   * Start showing the team's wins, even if they're small.   * Show those wins.   * So we would get up in front of the company and show like every town hall we'd ask for a little section where we could show the progress we're making   * and that could have been, hey? We built out this particular capability within our it organization or systems, we and and we demo   * showing, not telling, we built this new piece of factory equipment.   * We have built out the 1st part of our online configurator system.   * Whatever it was, we were constantly showing and celebrating those wins   * your Mvp, your minimum level of product. Really   * making sure that you had that focus. So our very 1st launch was online on motorola.com.   * we didn't take out too much. We wanted to celebrate that   * before we start integrating in with retailers, carriers   * getting that success, getting that momentum, having that win, getting that 1st channel that we knew we could control and own. We went through the carriers.   * I couldn't control them. They're outside of my direct influence.   * And, man, if I let them tell the narrative.   * I lose control right like, I don't know what they're gonna do. I can't control them. I can control what's in my domain. And so that's where I'm gonna start with my 1st success, even though the bigger volume was there. Through the carriers we went through what we could control in the beginning to have that success.   * and then, as we had that success, we had the pull coming from the market. So now we didn't have to push   * into the carriers. We had them coming, asking for us. So jd.com. And China wanted us to integrate into jd.com.   * We had orange from Europe. We had vodafone we had at, and T. Verizon, all of the major carriers wanting to integrate this, not just into their e-commerce sites, but into their stores, building kiosks, allowing them to customize and build the product. Yes.   * okay, so you get something going.   * How do you sustain it? How do you keep it?   * It's about building in this into the culture of the organization.   * So   * these smaller changes, then to get bigger changes. So we then extended this, not in just from phones, but into watches. So we were working on the Moto 3 60, which was the 1st   * smartwatch really, that was on the market built off of Android years before the apple.   * So we included those products. We included more products, not just one product suite of products. We started making deeper changes. We started building this more into the culture of the organization. We transformed organizations from waterfall methodologies to agile methodology.   * which at the time the whole company was very much on a waterfall mentality.   * We were trying to increase the the the pace of change. So within about 6 weeks   * after deploying everything, we moved the entire org that I was in into an agile type methodology away from waterfall. So building in these things these structural changes that consolidate.   * But it's also super important.   * And you don't just celebrate the successes.   * But you celebrate the failures and and the failures that are fast.   * The failures that are long are not to be celebrated. So there's a very clear distinction here.   * Failures are going to happen, and if they're not happening, you're not pushing hard enough, and there were plenty of failures along the way. The biggest one of those for us. Looking back at this particular initiative was, we expanded too fast.   * Instead of going deep and narrow.   * we went wide and far that distracted us, we did not have   * the number of resources to execute really well. So when we went into Brazil, when we went into Germany, we went into China.   * we had a not lovable product experience. But there was so much like push from the executives and from the regions to be like, we gotta have this, too. We gotta have this, too. There's so much pressure   * to do this. We were influenced by that pressure, and we shipped inferior product.   * As a result.   * we could have done that a lot faster. We could have figured out some of those failures a lot of that.   * Now, this comes also into your performance, management, because at Google. There was actually no way to look at your end of your reviews in my team   * that would allow you to actually celebrate failure.   * The rewards were mostly around shipping product   * and having some type of outcome.   * But if you spent a bunch of time uncovering a bunch of things through experiments   * like that's good. We want that to happen. We need a bunch of fast fails. I want a bunch of people testing stuff experimenting stuff to inspire the rest of the team or themselves, and what not to go after.   * So how do we celebrate that? How to give them credit for those things, and not just the people that ship the product. Because what ends up happening then is people start to dilute down   * the value prop into something that they know they can ship and doesn't push the limits.   * It's like, Oh, it's incrementalism to the extreme.   * I know this thing will be success super incremental, but everyone's asking for it, and I can get it done in 6 months.   * That's what we'll prioritize. Because that's what's gonna get you promoted.   * And you get this culture of like shipping stuff   * that gets people promoted. It's like shipping the org chart.   * This is what's happened. Like, you're shipping your performance management. If you don't have some way to account for those failures.   * and you could just start within your team right? Like you don't need to start organizationally wide. Build your own rubric, figure this out within your own team of how you celebrate this. You may have to get creative with how you interpret the wording in the performance management system.   * But you need to be able to lift those people up and show the organization   * that they are something to be celebrated. Celebrate those failures, of course, back with what you learned from it.   * and hopefully, then how we then took that learning and put it into something that shipped and saw that success. We have to start telling those stories. So people get comfortable with them.   * We've been talking a lot about changes within the organization, and how I can do these within. But oftentimes an organization   * just can't execute on.   * It may be because that area is so far out of their core competency   * that they may not have the talent.   * It may be. The culture has been built some certain way   * that they feel the need to build an innovation on whatever that may be.   * We've been talking a lot about, how do we integrate   * that innovation inside the organization? But there are other ways.   * So incubation, this is this is the idea of creating the separate team, the innovation, the Labs group.   * This is certainly a way that many words try to tackle this problem.   * There's benefits for it for sure.   * Dedicated team. Maybe they need to focus a little bit more on the horizon. 3\\.   * There's lots of tactics for how we make it successful. We read a lot about that in the Loon Shots book, how we staff that team, maybe how we integrate them back into the core business, how we incentivize them.   * But that is a model incubation model nurturing these new vets into a Labs team. How many of your orgs have this structure?   * Some talk to us about that.   * So we are part of a Labs team which is focusing on new initiatives at postman, especially postpart with, like the AI integration.   * But one of the biggest problem with Lab stem was like it was very siloed. So each individual will be. That's right, super siloed right? That's the downside of it. Now, these are not unsolvable ways. You can solve these problems. But if you build a structure like this, you have to at least acknowledge there's a tendency for that to happen   * right? And we want to build the the transitions and the transfers between these teams. Who else has a structure like this? I saw some hands over here, Yvonne.   * So I'm actually part of this kind of innovation and commission that was created a few years ago. Organization with, we even have, like   * separate legal entity, which allows us to have like own route to market, and we kind of try hard to   * make things work. And we were able to unlock   * until certain level. Actually, some innovations that big organization have been able to. Yeah, that's right. It creates some white space. There's benefits. The problem is always. Then how do we integrate   * integration. That's the other model. This is the Leor Ron model. This is the Uber freight model. This is taking this and spreading it   * within all the teams, integrating it throughout   * many times. The downside of this   * is, I'm spreading it within a structure that already exists, a business that already exists. Are they gonna unlock a brand new business model or brand new business.   * Maybe, Nick, but probably problem.   * I don't have a team that's really trying to disrupt itself.   * Imagine if if you were. You were in Netflix   * and they had the DVD mail order.   * It's a DVD Mail order team is gonna have a team focus on like killing the DVD order team?   * Probably not.   * They're probably gonna innovate about how to make that more efficient. And all the other cool stuff. They have a horizon 3 for that business.   * But isn't the construct of that business often.   * So sometimes it's helpful to have that that white space separate team that can really disrupt itself.   * Sometimes there's a need for a combination hybrid. But this idea of integrating   * it's fair. It's super tied in to the way things are done.   * They can bring insights that oftentimes that Labs team may not have   * lots of benefits to the integrated model   * one. We talked about these 2 before the one we haven't talked about really that much.   * It's the acquisition.   * Why would I acquire definition?   * Smooth?   * What what I'm thinking of here is like basically hiring a consulting firm. That's what my experience was. I I was working in a human capital consulting, and we did a lot of   * organizational change management projects. And at 1st I was kind of like.   * you know, why? Couldn't? Because started this first, st when this is my 1st job   * did once I saw it like. So it's very.   * And so having someone to push them along.   * So the consultant model we're actually talking about. It's a it's a flavor of this.   * this one is more around acquiring a company   * I can talk to. I I work for accenture song, which was the creation of all like it was just, I think we did some like 100 something acquisitions over the course of 2 years to basically build out the innovation arm, build out anything, acquisition, strategy acquired. Durga 5 acquired fjord acquired. I came in through fjord. But we acquired all these to build in these capabilities, and the struggle we actually have now is.   * had we have a lot of agencies that essentially do redundant work because they own the same. You know they do the same thing, but they own different relationships. So navigating that change is a is a big problem.   * This is a valid strategy. Rishi.   * The way that I the way that I   * condenses like you're you're doing by buying innovation for 3 things   * the talent expertise and market contacts like taking an example like Google within ads. They had. They had adwords. Now, Google ads, purely an auction based system. And then they acquired double click to basically understand the programmatic side, which is now one of one of the like.   * like the largest portion of their ads business. And so instead of them creating their own programming system, they acquired double click to really understand the universe and then build on stuff internally, you don't just have to have a Labs group. You don't have to have the Uber freight dedicated capacity of the team   * buy it.   * You can acquire it. You have the talent that's there. When we were at Motorola we acquired a company called Good Mobile, messaging.   * good mobile messaging was acquired, not because we wanted to become a messaging company, but because they had the talent and expertise around building like web based apps.   * And we had a bunch of firmware engineers by and large.   * We didn't have a lot of people that knew how to build web based stuff. We're gonna build smartphones with services that knew some types of server based systems and infrastructure around data centers. We need to acquire that capability. So they acquired good, mobile messaging. We never actually really did much with that business, but that's the team that ended up shipping our 1st android devices.   * We had the talent that we needed to acquire. We did not have that internally would take us way too long to try to recruit that talent. We could pick up an instant. Team. Boom\\! There we are, know they work together well, we don't have any risk about that   * cool. Pick them up.   * But isn't this awful strategy that companies use in order to not be disruptive?   * For example, like in blog post would be about for sure they should have   * 100%. They should have done that. They should have gone through an acquisition strategy. Yes.   * yep, you got it.   * Luo can use also the venture model.   * My 1st company that I worked in United States was essentially one of these   * venture funded windows competing again with one cluster. Got it?   * We're gonna call this brokerage. So you you nicely teed up the next phase.   * So Lubo is talking about this idea of like a venture arm or a venture model.   * Even within a company, you can have a venture investment   * right? That's gonna go off and invest in companies that maybe you get acquired. Maybe we just learn from them. But this brokered innovation, this could also be partnerships. This could be who here is familiar with techstars, the accelerator.   * They have corporate sponsors, so techstars partnered with capital one right, whatever that may be. This is another example of brokered innovation. The ability for you to use partnerships to identify trends technologies. Maybe I have a venture arm that invests in those companies.   * Who's familiar with Boston consulting Group X, ecgx.   * They're our competitor. Right? So Bcgx. Explain what bcgx is. Kind of main. So Bcgx was a combination of Bcg digital ventures platinian, which is their like tech group   * but essentially what they do is they do venture architecture design within their. So so, for example, there's a pet insurance company called pumpkin pet insurance that was direct. Spin off for Zoettis and Zoetti came to Bcgx. We said, Well, you know we you know, understand, you know, pet parents and all that. But we really need to understand the space of how to do preventative care. And so   * they incubated this entire effort within Bcgx. They brought in their own people outside people from. They built it and they spun it out. That's right. So this is exactly the model. So they take people from inside the legacy franchise business.   * the team people from Bcg, they've mashed them both together into a separate company that sits outside. That's controlled by both Bcg. And the parent.   * but but independent. The people they put in there, they actually give equity to it as well. So it's like a Mini startup. So these employees from Bcg. And the parent company have equity in this new enterprise.   * and the legacy business as 1st right of refusal   * to absorb it back in. If they   * so this is the idea of like a brokered innovation. Lots of different ones like this.   * I quite like this one. This idea of taking people from within. They're the the experts, the the artists and soldiers from inside that company and putting them out because it doesn't   * limit them by a bunch of structure. Let's just take something simple as performance management. Even if I put people in a Labs group.   * If your company is very rigid and legacy business like, there's a lot of structures finance, Hr procurement like, if you wanna acquire new technology and labs, you still have to go through your procurement team. You're like, Oh, my.   * like this is gonna take us 6 months to get this contract signed like, you're not able to keep up with the pace that we need to move on because we're being encumbered   * by these systems that were built to scale.   * built to be nimble and fast. And so if you find yourself in an organization that feels like this. This brokered innovation model oftentimes is an interesting one to explore.   * All right, we're going to go ahead, and that pretty much takes us to the end of the lecture. There's a couple extra points I'm going to bring back   * after our break. But with this I'm going to transition to our guest. Speaker.   * Can you hear me? Okay.   * ![Majd Bakar][image12]   * **Majd Bakar**   * 01:02:03   * Yes, I can.   * ![John Renaldi][image13]   * **John Renaldi**   * 01:02:04   * Alright. So Maj, as I mentioned, is our our guest speaker today. Maj. Is our Vice President of engineering at Google. He and I met he was working on the Fitbit team and was running engineering post integration. So when Google acquired Fitbit they were rolling that all into one organization, and he was running both clients, server and application engineering teams.   * He has since expanded his role to cover both home and health. So, having home organization within. So Google home assistant types of technologies. But he's been at Google for a while, has seen a number of different consumer innovations within his teams.   * and through the kind of concept or ideas of disrupting within. He's going to kind of walk us through his experience at Google, and how he's taken some of the things that we just spoke about and implemented them in a larger organization like Google. Thanks for joining us today. And I'm going to   * and things over to you. I will stop sharing, because I know you have some slides.   * ![Majd Bakar][image14]   * **Majd Bakar**   * 01:03:15   * Thanks, John. Nice to meet you all. I'm happy to be to be here. So, as John said, I run home and health at Google.   * I'll wait for these slides.   * I want to just to share with you. I know you guys are looking at how we can do innovation or how we can drive innovation. And there are multiple ways of doing that. Whether you're in startups or large companies. Today, I'll talk to you about what my experience was driving change within Google. And I had to.   * ![John Renaldi][image15]   * **John Renaldi**   * 01:03:55   * To share whenever you're ready.   * ![Majd Bakar][image16]   * **Majd Bakar**   * 01:03:57   * Okay, let's see.   * are you able to see it? Sorry I'm not able to.   * ![John Renaldi][image17]   * **John Renaldi**   * 01:04:16   * Why don't you share your tab? Because it's like showing us a vertical screen? Maybe.   * ![Majd Bakar][image18]   * **Majd Bakar**   * 01:04:34   * This work.   * ![John Renaldi][image19]   * **John Renaldi**   * 01:04:37   * Really small. For some reason.   * ![Majd Bakar][image20]   * **Majd Bakar**   * 01:04:40   * Okay. Let me see.   * ![John Renaldi][image21]   * **John Renaldi**   * 01:04:45   * That got whatever you just did made it bigger.   * ![Majd Bakar][image22]   * **Majd Bakar**   * 01:04:48   * Yeah, it's my screen. So.   * ![John Renaldi][image23]   * **John Renaldi**   * 01:04:50   * There we go\\! There we now we're good. Perfect.   * Yes, yes.   * ![Majd Bakar][image24]   * **Majd Bakar**   * 01:04:56   * Learning zoom on the fly.   * so as I said, I, I worked at Google for for a while. And just talk talking about disruption from within the the company.   * So the most   * the more the company is, is successful, the bigger it is, the more it can generate revenue.   * the less it lends itself to disruption, or it become less and less agile about making a change. There's a fear of cannibalization of existing product revenue stream that they want to protect. Also, there's the mentality of we are used to doing it in one way. Let's continue what we are doing, especially when it is successful.   * Usually, the most disruptive innovators are new entrant that don't have much to lose. They're coming in with nothing, and they can grow exponentially   * and a lot of times. By the way, before working at Google, I work at Microsoft. So I also experienced another large company where they missed the mark where there were some major changes that were happening in the industry. When I was at Microsoft it was when the iphone was launched, and they missed completely the mark on the mobile revolution there. And it's again due to the focus that they had   * particularly at Microsoft, around protecting windows protecting office, and how we can keep our revenue stream.   * So   * I would say, one of the biggest tool that you have in terms of driving change within such large organization is really influence trying to drive alignment, trying to drive other people in the company that are, whether they're decision makers or people that are that will be doing the work, but trying to to build that sphere of influence   * and bringing people along with you. It starts with demonstrating expertise. People need to trust you that you know what you're talking about showing results. You have to grow within that organization to build that trust. And then you need to build relationship relationships are really, really important in this setting where you need to have   * that ability to go and convince people. And sometimes you can convince them with data and very objective views, but a lot of times it requires subjective and emotional connection that will drive that change.   * as part of that you need to identify. You need to work on like, how can you build that sphere of influence? How can you bring people along? Try to identify key people, key stakeholders that are going to help you in making these decisions. They might be either people that are trusted, people that have a lot of expertise in a particular domain, or   * people that are really the decision makers. In one of the examples that I'll show you later. We went to a decision maker about who is driving product development at Google. And they are deciding what are the products that we need to invest in   * and you need to also know what is important for this individual?   * not from a personal perspective, but more from a company and and organizational perspective. What do they care about what drives their success, what drives, what motivates their goals, and how you can make sure that you are aligning yourself or aligning your goals to theirs?   * a lot of times, and I would say, especially if you're driving change or instigating change, you're going to be trying to influence without authority. You don't have the team that is reporting to you. You don't have. You are not the final decision maker. You need to help someone else make that decision.   * and in that sense, you really need to be data driven. You need to use fact. You need to make sure that you are bringing something valuable to the table.   * There is a   * like this, the idea of storytelling. How does this fit within, whether it is the company or the large organization's objective? How does it fit within their goals. And how does it benefit them? Ultimately, particularly when you're making a major shift? You need to show, what do we lose by not making that change.   * And then you need to also. Make sure that you are really   * not just saying, Okay, we need to go after the mobile market, or we need to go after now. Everybody's talking about after Llm. And we need to have Llm. In our product. What is it that you are providing like, bring solutions to the table. Not not just the problem. It's it's really important that you are seen as somebody who is identifying the challenge or identifying the change, but also bringing about how you're going to make that change.   * And as you grow in an organization especially well established organization, you need to make space for these possibilities. You need to to help individual in your organization or smaller teams to to   * to have time and resources to to think about these changes in some of the organization that I run. I had like small dedicated team that are just like focusing on this, that honestly, doesn't work all the time, and it it creates like a 2 plus system within the team. But   * if we start thinking about okay, you are always working in rapid iteration. You're always working in a world where you're building incremental improvement on your product day over day. That helps, because then you are able to shift very, very quickly when when things change, or when you identify a particular change you're able to to make that change quickly, and you are able to get it to your user in a fast way.   * So this is like, especially when you're working in agile. That's 1 of the way of of getting things to to move fast. Another thing is   * you need to create a a psychologically safe environment for this experimentation, particularly the ability to it's safe to fail. Learn from the failure, especially here in Silicon Valley. Everybody said, Okay, we enjoy failure safe, fast, sorry, fail, fast.   * But what does that mean? It means that you are really thinking about   * taking those risks, and you are looking at. If if the failure from these risks happen, what am I going to learn from that. But then there's the other aspect of it, which is.   * can we like   * contain that failure? Is the failure going to be too big for us to absorb or can we absorb that risk?   * The other part is, you need to be nimble. And this goes to my point about agile or incremental improvement. You need to be able to react quickly when disruption happened. You need to be able as an organization, you need to think about. Okay, what would happen if there is a change in industry, or what would happen if there's a new technology that disrupts the foundation that we are building on.   * how can we use that? And how can we be able to to drive that? And especially as organization grow when you talk like from tens to hundreds to thousands.   * communication become really key. How do you communicate that change? And how do you bring your team along with you? That becomes a challenge. And in there, making sure that you have that trust, you have that ability to go   * in a quick iteration that helps the team adjust to these changes.   * As I said, you need to. When we talk about it's it's okay to fail or fail fast.   * You need to be. Make sure to. You. Understand, what does that mean? It's not that you can fail continuously, and I'll show you an example later, because that's not something that is sustainable. And it's not something that you can really make a product or make a profitable entity out of. You need to define. What is it that you are trying to build? What does success look like   * go in terms of milestones and and iteration, so you can at least assess yourself or assess the the the product as it grows, and be able to. As I said adjust when you when you you're not on the track, or you, there are disruption that that are happening.   * And you need to set a limit. You can't say I'm gonna fail continuously at some point. What do we do to to stop the the losses.   * And this is where you need to. When you are making these changes, you need to have the right team with you. When we, we, we talk about   * the disruption. Usually you are starting something from scratch. You are making a shift or a new technology or a new product. So you're going from 0 to one. The 0 to one. Innovators are completely different than or sorry. The people that are working on 0 to one product are have completely different mentality, and in some cases different skill set than the people that will take your product from one to 100 where they are going to scale it. They are more   * willing to to take risk. They're more willing to to move fast and break things. And   * honestly, when you are going from 0 to one.   * You don't have an existing customer base. So you're thinking differently about the risk that you're taking to your users. But when you're going from one to 100 or 100 to a thousand. This is where you have an existing customer base. And you have to think, okay, I have existing users on my product. How do I make those changes without disruption or without losing these users? That's that becomes a really big motivator. So you need to   * know where you are in that stage. And what is the team that you need to build to help you on that   * again? I I can't emphasize enough that Big Bang releases or Big Bang product launches do not work.   * You need to go always incrementally. This is my experience. Maybe in some other places it might work, but at least throughout my career. Whenever we go in terms. And okay, we need to make like something that big. And you go stealth for like 2 years. And then, all of a sudden, the whole thing happened that that will never, ever work   * incrementally, delivering something to your users, getting feedback, being able to adjust as disruptor disruption happens, or as you're learning from from   * your usage of the product or your user feedback and being able to provide incremental improvement over time. That's always where big success happens.   * you need to balance also. Especially, I'm talking here from big companies. When you are a focused startup. It's a different thing. But when you are a big company, you you still have other stuff, especially companies like Facebook, Google Apple, where you have even like a a broader product portfolio. You need to look at how you allocate resources strategically. You can't. You can't just like put all your resources in one. You are really looking at. Okay.   * I'm now in a transition. And you see it now with Facebook, where they're in a big transition from their traditional business to. They want to go really big on Llm. And they are making that shift in terms of their resources, both money, wise, human or otherwise.   * and how they are doing it methodically. That's something that you need to look at. There's always a prioritization exercise there. And as you're prioritizing, you need to know, okay, where am I going to be in 3 years? Where am I going to be in 5 years? You need to think strategically. And what are the changes that I need to make to be ready for that   * in the future.   * I'll show you 2 case studies that I worked on very closely. So chromecast is a product. I started at Google. And the idea of that, this is a small streaming device that reimagined how you interact with your content in the living room, particularly on your TV.   * We launched this, I started to Google in 2011\\. So I immediately pitched this product there, and we launched it in 2013, and the idea was to bring a simplified, content discovery   * and consumption to users. It's we started. I I was running a   * part of a larger team. We started this by going and dedicating, we, we started 3 people, 2 engineers and one product managers. And we gave them full autonomy in terms of, okay, go think about this problem. This is what we need to to build. We define the idea and focused it   * for   * like, really narrowed it. To one use case, all you need to do is being able to cast. Use your phone as a remote control, discover the content and play it on TV. The TV should be just a video player, nothing else and ignore anything any other use cases. Keep it simple on on that.   * The team was laser focused. They spend like we had a prototype running in a matter of 2 weeks and   * this was the 1st hardware product that we were building at Google. So we didn't even know how to build hardware. But by simplifying it in terms of okay, it needs to be small. It needs to to be on Wi-fi only, and we didn't want to have any buttons on it. We didn't have want to have a remote control that really drove that focus. And it helped us build a product. That   * was very constrained. But it was   * really like, perfect at solving one problem, how do you play your Netflix content? We started with Netflix first.st And Youtube, how do you play your Netflix and Youtube content on your large screen? Easily. That was the the statement, and we managed to deliver on that.   * having limited resources   * both in terms of number of people when we shipped chromecast like at the end. We had the total team, including marketing, including operation. And everything was 40 people.   * Something that's like now is almost impossible at Google at this small size, but having that constraint helped us focus and helped us make a lot of good decisions, at least in retrospect. We we found that we were really very optimal in terms of using our resources and making a very good prioritization call and the right   * priorities in terms of what what we want to deliver to our users, but also we limited that we constrained the product substantially, both in terms of the user experience and in terms of the hardware, and that actually helped us in building a lot of innovation there. In thinking about how do you set up the device when you don't have any buttons on it. How do you use your phone set up? And that's really translated into a lot of other innovation used throughout the industry.   * in this. Here we we like the product. Really. grew substantially over the years for 10 years, I think. We we sold more than 100 million of chromecast and it became a disruptive disruptive in the industry.   * Amazon, Roku and others followed. And it's really, of course, now, Amazon is much bigger than that. It's really propelled the streaming focus in video and media in general.   * oh, sorry. I just went through the slide. Let me go here. Another example that I worked on as well. After I worked on chromecast, I started another idea at Google, which is about cloud gaming. So Stadia was defined as a new era of gaming where? We didn't want to have a console. We didn't want to go and build a hardware.   * Well, okay, that's a strong statement. We didn't want to build a console. Or have you pay hundreds or thousands of dollars for a PC that you you would need to maintain to run your games. Why not run all your games in the cloud in Google Cloud, and then we stream it to any device, no download, no update, no installation needed.   * As long as you have a browser you can play your game, and we're talking here about high end triple a games.   * but unfortunately we really did not scope the problem correctly. We went really big. In. If you look at the Gdc. Which is a game developer Conference   * Conference in 2019, we announced, like, we are completely changing the world before we had the product. And we we went really big in terms of   * trying to disrupt the console market. So we went head to head with consoles which is Sony and Microsoft very, very well established companies, and and they have their not just the hardware and the user base. But they have the content which is really key here. And we really try to solve multiple problems at the same time.   * One of the biggest challenges we had is we, we decided to go. You play on your laptop desktop, TV and mobile and solving this across the board is very, very hard.   * That's in contrast to what chromecast was, where it was really laser focused. It was trying to solve one particular one problem.   * We also ran into an issue where we were not just solving the user pro like the consumption problem. We're also trying to solve the creation problem, how do you create games? For in the cloud gaming era? So we needed to change the mentality of game developers.   * the biggest challenge that stadia faced is the business model. We created a very, very complex business model. It's basically a subscription plus you need to buy games. Users got confused with that. You need to make sure that the message to the user, both from how you use the product and how you pay for that product needs to be simple. That was, in my opinion, that was like really what killed Stadia.   * And of course the established competitors were very much entrenched, and because gaming is really about fresh content, exclusive content.   * Now it's changing. But at least in 2019, that really made it very hard for that for stadia to to succeed. Eventually we we closed stadia in 2022   * But it was, as I said, earlier, in terms of fail fast. It was a lesson that we learned at Google in terms of. We limited our losses eventually and in terms of How do you build a new disruptive product. How do you drive a big change in whether it is a well established space or a completely green space?   * What what would require, or how do you define such a product?   * To me? The biggest learning here is simplicity is king. You need to be very, very simple in terms of the product offering, how you're delivering to to your user and how your user will understand it. You can't have technology be the setting point. It needs to be the experience. And how me as a user, am I gonna benefit from this?   * Finally, I'll just go quickly into some of the tools that I use in terms of driving these disruption. Of course, engineering talent is really key. You need to have the right engineering talent. You need to have not just the technical skill, but also the personalities for people that are willing to take risks that are willing to come with you and people that can afford a lot of ambiguity and changes.   * Naturally, we like to have order, and we like to know what we're going to do next. But when you are in a disruption you don't know, and things can change day to day, months to months. So you need to have the right people there. You need to empower that team. Give them time funding, mentorship,   * resources. And of course, the environment, the psychological, psychologically safe environment where they can go and experiment and they don't. They are not always worried about. Okay, if I make here a mistake, what would be the cost of that? Yes, of course we don't want people to make mistakes, but it's fine if you make that and you learn it. So this is where that iteration, being able to adjust quickly is going to be important.   * Another big tool that's coming now is AI I mean, particularly with Llm, it's transforming our perception of how technology can be used. But there's a lot of hype you know. You see here, everybody wants to have AI or Llm. Now, as part of the name of the company, or the name of the product, and they are shoving it down everyone's throat. So you have to be careful about how you measure that. One thing that we know is.   * and that was proven to you 2 weeks ago, like we knew it before, but it was now proven 2 weeks ago, with deep seek models are going to be commoditized. All models are eventually going to be like we thought it would be a couple of years. But I think it's going to happen this year. They're all going to reach that same level, and you'll have the same functionality or same capability from all the models. And even if one of them jump ahead. Others will just catch up in a matter of days   * not months. It's literally days like from deep sea to the to the other company that announced yesterday. We are seeing like changes happening   * on the model in in planning speed. So you need to think about, how can you use Llm. How can you use AI, the application layer, or the services that you can provide on top of that are going to be key here.   * there's definitely a major disruption in terms of software development. It's gonna happen over time. I don't think we are going to go in a state where we don't need software engineers anymore. I think the type of software engineers that will be working will change the tools that they are using, how they go about their development. That's always gonna be adjusted, and it will be influenced by this Llm.   * The tools that we will have are going to be more and more powerful.   * You need to know where you can use AI. It can be used everywhere. There are still some areas where AI actually is not as good as as human. But in some areas, especially when you're talking about pattern matching or being able to to make infer decisions from a large set of data. This is where AI excels both like traditional AI Ml or Llm. For example.   * I would say in image, diagnostic or image identification. This is where perception AI is really now surpassing the human looking at an X-ray and being able to identify cancerous cells or broken bones, this is where they're doing much better than any radiologist.   * but there is a challenge. Still, there is a lack of trust in AI, particularly in Llm. People don't trust it. Expert. Don't trust it, so we can't go to a hospital and say, Okay, now use this tool, and it will replace all your radiologists. The medical community still hasn't accepted this, and it will take time for that.   * There's still a lot of hallucination. This is a solvable problem, and it will be solved over time, and I see it actually improving substantially week over week.   * But still that actually is impacting the trust. And we are still working on that multi-step action and multi-step reasoning is improving. We are seeing models that are able of doing that. But still there's room. So you're gonna see major changes there. And the goal here is, you need to know how to use this new tool, how to apply it and how to build on top of that.   * Let me go to the next slide.   * I talked a bit about this earlier like Startup, definitely, if you if you are going into a green space or you are really trying to drive disruption startups are the best way. But the challenge with Startup is, you might run out of funding. You might have the the wrong idea from the start, and you need to adjust you don't have enough resources. How do you attract talent? All of that, I mean one out of 10 startups succeeds, so like the the rate of failure there is high.   * On the other side Corporation. Large corporation. They are very, very slow. The they are very risk, averse and   * you might not have the right talent there, because people that are working in in large corporation are usually want to have an established, and they know what they what they're doing tomorrow. So   * you can play with with these 2\\. You can adjust from one to the other, and a lot of startups end up being gobbled by a large corporation when there is a path to success. Not always. But these are 2 options that are available, and there might be also others that would apply.   * And then the other thing here is you want to to plan for scale early, no matter what disruption you are making, you need to think about what, how you do scale this. How do you? If it is in a consumer space. How do you reach millions or hundreds of millions of users? How does this product appeal to the masses in enterprise? How does this really drive? success for other corporations.   * You you need to think about that. So   * the the challenge here is in terms of building the cost model. How how does it. How does the cost play there? If the if your cost is linear every time you add a new user, it costs you the same amount of money, then that's this is not a product that can scale. So you need to think about the this the scaling exponential scale.   * And again driver's constraint. Make sure that you are thinking in terms in terms of   * what? What are the constraint that I can put on my system, or on my product or my services that would allow me to to think about, scale and go for the masses   * with that. I'm done. If you have any questions.   * ![John Renaldi][image25]   * **John Renaldi**   * 01:33:35   * Awesome. Thanks, Matt, appreciate it.   * One thing I wanted to drill in on is around criteria for failure you had mentioned, like really important, to have a bunch of criteria for fast fails.   * Just make sure that these things don't continue to fail. Could you talk and elaborate a little bit about that. What are the types of criteria that you use in your teams to kind of box that.   * ![Majd Bakar][image26]   * **Majd Bakar**   * 01:34:05   * Yeah, I mean, so to me, there are 2 variables that I use usually time I need whatever we're building to   * to succeed in, let's say, 6 months or 12 months after launch. I need to see a particular goal, let's say, user goal or revenue goal or or engagement goal and make sure that we are tracking to that. And if we're not meeting it, how can we adjust   * ideally? You, you will have it at a much finer granularity where? Okay? Each month. This is what we're the the goal that we want to reach. And if we're not how we're doing it.   * The other one is okay. What is the cost that I'm willing to absorb? This is something that we did with stadia. How much money are we willing to lose there? And   * over time we realize if if we're losing that much and we continue at this rate, and for us it took. I think it took 2 years I I left the the team before that, so I don't remember the details. But if if the the loss rate is not adjusting this is where we make a big decisions in that case was shutting down the product. But in other cases, it's okay, is there are there ways to adjust? What? What are the changes that we would make.   * ![John Renaldi][image27]   * **John Renaldi**   * 01:35:30   * Questions from the class Rishi.   * So I remember testing Stadia when I was at Google, I thought it was very promising, but I was very disappointed and very pumped about how it was launched.   * Do you think that   * an acquisition innovate like buying innovation or buying expertise from what's in the marketplace would have been an alternative. Strategy. Would you have considered to make success.   * ![Majd Bakar][image28]   * **Majd Bakar**   * 01:36:00   * in some cases. Yes, for stadia. I don't think so. Unfortunately, because stadia dependent a lot on Google infrastructure and Google tech stack absorbing a. A. An acquisition of this scale would have been a an integration nightmare.   * because you, you need basically to go and readjust Google has a proprietary tech stack inside of Google. So to to make that change would have been a a big endeavor.   * ![John Renaldi][image29]   * **John Renaldi**   * 01:36:33   * And Maj is speaking about this because it's a really good team   * to his experience with Fitbit, which was also an integration into Google's infrastructure.   * ![Majd Bakar][image30]   * **Majd Bakar**   * 01:36:44   * Okay.   * ![John Renaldi][image31]   * **John Renaldi**   * 01:36:45   * Can you talk a little bit about the Fitbit integration?   * And that was an area where Google looked at and acquired an innovation and said, Hey, listen\\! We don't have a brand. You don't have necessarily a low power and piece of this technology. We don't have some services. So there was some reasoning that maybe at surface made sense for acquisition. But from an integration perspective, likely I'm guessing some things weren't   * fully appreciated. Maybe you could speak a little bit to that. That is obviously an area where- where Google did do an integration and acquisition for innovation.   * ![Majd Bakar][image32]   * **Majd Bakar**   * 01:37:26   * Yeah, I mean, tech companies, especially large tech companies. When they acquire others, they can't run them as independent. They can't run them separately. It doesn't make sense, and it's not financially viable. And also the reason why a tech company acquires another one is so it can complement and integrate with the rest of its product.   * and therefore you, you do need to have a integration both at the business as well as the technology side. Mean, especially in software. We can't try like we are in a world where all software are like live software and services. You. You can't just write it once and forget it. There's like cost of maintenance, and it grows over time   * as well as you need to ensure that you are innovating, because otherwise it will stagnate and fall behind. So in the Fitbits case.   * they they were on a completely separate stack completely.   * well, which is fine. I mean, they they were a startup, and they they built their stuff using open source tools that are that were available in the market. But they can't run within Google. So we we needed to completely do a a, I would say.   * full integration of the tech stack and rewrite into Google to bring it to Google Standard, to bring it to the same level as the rest of Google services and products. So we can maintain it in a way that's cost efficient.   * And it it is. It's it's very, very hard, it's not. It's not an easy thing to do.   * ![John Renaldi][image33]   * **John Renaldi**   * 01:39:15   * Gonna give you the remote so that he can hear you.   * Thank you. When you're talking about.   * You got some good points about how to influence your   * how to influence with arguing with data. It sounds like it was a lot about persuasion. When you're working with peers. How do you go about. Do you have any tips on how to influence someone that's reporting to you on a dotted line that you don't have that direct authority? How do you perhaps incentivize them?   * ![Majd Bakar][image34]   * **Majd Bakar**   * 01:39:57   * Yeah. So I think the 1st thing you need to do here is to see what motivates them. What do they care about? What? What is, what is the goal of their team or their management chain or their organization? For success. And see if that aligns with you. So you need to find, like some alignments   * between what you are proposing or what's what you want them to do? What's what's the change that you want to introduce and their their goals. In other cases you might need to show them. Okay.   * here here is the disruption. And this, this is how the disruption is gonna impact you. I'm gonna use here a very old example. But if we we had a team at Microsoft where they were working on windows ce. And the introduction of the iphone into 2,008 was a disruption there for that team, but they did not react to it   * in term we we were. Now there are sometimes, unfortunately, whatever I'm telling you has is not a guarantee for success. In some cases people don't don't change and or can't can't feel the the disruption. And and they won't react. But bringing to them. Okay.   * this new idea of a application running on a touch screen with a would completely transform the space that that we are in, and it would it would really disrupt the desktop, which is where Microsoft was investing heavily.   * That disruption has an impact on you has an impact on how you're gonna sell OS, how you're gonna drive office usage to to the Enterprise.   * And it did help in terms of they started thinking about, okay, how do I bring my services. How do I bring my application to to the mobile space and   * and make that change?   * Unfortunately, at the time Microsoft was very slow, Microsoft changed since I left, so I I don't know how they act now, but in 2,008 they were very slow in in that change, and they wouldn't adjust. But you do need to bring as I said, how does this change or this new idea will impact you?   * And how can it help you? So that latter part is important? So you appeal to their goals. You try to align with their aspirations and see how you can bring that.   * Thank you.   * ![John Renaldi][image35]   * **John Renaldi**   * 01:42:31   * Any questions.   * ![Christine and Josh][image36]   * **Christine and Josh**   * 01:42:36   * Yeah.   * you, I really like the chromecast story. It was really interesting. And I think it's really cool. I think a lot of people are getting a bit confused with this iteration versus Big Bang. And we like, we want to make a big innovation. And we like, we think it's a big idea. And then but you also need to get there iteratively. Can you tell us about how, with chromecast like? How did you find the 1st customers and the 1st users of chromecast. Was that like your mom or your parents? Or how did you like evolve?   * you said you got the you had an Mvp. Or you had something working in 2 weeks like, how quickly did you get that into people's hands?   * ![Majd Bakar][image37]   * **Majd Bakar**   * 01:43:13   * Yeah, I mean, there's a story about it. I got inspired by my wife on this. I was watching her like she was trying to do for a couple of years watching Netflix on on our TV, and we had an Xbox at the time, and how she was using that she would use her laptop to go discover. And there's a story about it. You can find it on the Internet. But   * so the 1st   * iteration, the way we did is we said, Go hack it try existing. Whatever exist. We had an existing product called Google TV, which basically had a browser running on the TV. So like, use that as the basis.   * I was insisting that we are going to use. HTML 5\\. I don't know how familiar you are with video streamers. HTML 5, at the time, was introducing this concept of a video tag. So you can easily build a streaming video inside your browser. So since we have a browser and chrome running on TV, use this as the basis.   * Show me how I can use my phone to look at. Okay, I'll I'll go to the Netflix application on the phone. And from there I can just select a video. And once I know what that video Id is just send it to the chrome browser and play it in the in the video tag.   * literally, it took those 2 engineers 2 weeks, actually, not even 2 weeks, less than 2 weeks, and they they showed it to me. And then we started shopping it around inside of Google. So we're showing that   * experience. We showed it at the time Sundar was our Vp. And he who's the CEO of Google now? And he basically got excited about it. Then when we told him, Okay, we are gonna couple this, this is the experience. But we are gonna build it using a small $35 at the time I said, $25 device   * didn't see I didn't reach my goal.   * that's this small and it will hide behind your TV. No one will see it. We just put it behind your TV. It is Wi-fi and it can just   * stream. And you don't need to worry about it. We're not gonna put any ui any   * what we call chrome on on your TV. It's all just about the video. And then we'll build on top of that eventually. And we did like. If you see now the evolution of what chromecast has become and all the streaming devices we build on top of that. But we, we limited initially. Just we want to play video.   * So our 1st iteration was literally with Netflix and Youtube. Youtube was internal Netflix. We had a good relationship with Netflix at the time. Well, still we do, and we work very closely with them. So we developed it to play these video, and we were focused on on that. Then we added music. Then gaming came like with Stadia and others, and then we built on top. But the idea was like we built that quick prototype, and then from there we   * hardware is different. You can't build hardware in in that sense hardware is very waterfally. But we used this software where it is running independent of the hardware.   * And we we iterate on it on how we can. Hone hone down that experience. And then we build the hardware and couple the 2 together.   * Does that answer your question?   * ![John Renaldi][image38]   * **John Renaldi**   * 01:46:38   * The key there is like, you know, understanding what- what says it's big Bang is like, think of stadia and chrome. Stadium is like the. We try to throw everything on the whole kitchen sink and make this big launch that does everything   * versus much tighter focus of bringing like a minimum, lovable product to market. Focus on one thing, build that innovation, build the momentum, build on top, go go add on top, add on top versus stadia, like throwing everything at it. So I think that's like what we're trying to kind of delineate here between, like what he says, the Big Bang versus like incremental incrementalism gets a bad rap   * of like, oh, just small little stuff. It's not very innovative, like, you see the chromecast very innovative, but like they obviously didn't throw everything at it to get it out the door. And so that's what I think. We're trying to differentiate here between the 2\\.   * ![Majd Bakar][image39]   * **Majd Bakar**   * 01:47:30   * Exactly.   * ![John Renaldi][image40]   * **John Renaldi**   * 01:47:33   * Yeah, he's thinking of like product managers or technical product managements like, what's something that makes them stand out for you and your organization and say, Okay, this guy is just great, or what some skills that we need to develop to kind of stand out from the rest.   * ![Majd Bakar][image41]   * **Majd Bakar**   * 01:47:50   * That's a very good question. I I mean, what I look for is, are you really thinking   * independent, or like trying to to decouple history   * or not grounding yourself in history, or how we are doing things and trying new things. You're willing to to make change where it makes sense change sometimes doesn't make sense, but where it makes sense, you're willing to make change. And you are thinking in.   * how can I improve the the user experience. I I and by user experience, I don't mean ux, I mean, like the actual ultimate experience for that user. And   * what are the changes that we should make to to help them achieve whatever goal they are trying to do in a in a simpler way. So thinking in terms of simplicity, thinking in terms of how the user benefit, like thinking about the user first, st are the thing that I that I look for I I like product managers that are   * like thinking big, but executing small so they they have the big ideas, but they are able to distill it in terms of here are the small changes that I can make, or the small incremental build up that I can take to to get me there and not get hung up on. No, it needs to to reach that perfection. It needs to reach everything at the same time.   * I think that's that's where you asked about product manager. This is, I think, is the trade that I look for the most on the Tpm side, or the technical program manager. That we call it Google. It's more of somebody who can really see behind the corner people that are able to not just track schedule and build plan and and seeing. Okay, how can scrum or agile work here? But more in terms of okay, what are the risks that can happen.   * And, more importantly, what are the mitigation I can put in place to to protect against these risks, and being able again to to really execute at the smallest granularity possible.   * ![John Renaldi][image42]   * **John Renaldi**   * 01:50:19   * You talked a lot about the difference in focus between stadia and chromecast. So in this class, in this program, we talk a lot about narrowing to the user, to the type of user that you would want for your product. It sounds like for chromecast. What you narrowed to was a particular use, but it was broadly applicable over all users. Can you maybe talk about how you choose to narrow what dimension you pick user use, etc.   * ![Majd Bakar][image43]   * **Majd Bakar**   * 01:50:47   * Yeah. I mean, we tried to do it with stadia, to be honest, but we were not successful. I think the push there to go broader and and bigger was too compelling, and we lost sight of things.   * I I would say, like, there's something called user segmentation where you try to look at the market as a whole and try to segment users into categories. I'm not a big fan of this, but it's it's 1 tools that that you can use. And then look at which users makes more sense for your organization. For your   * goals and what you're trying to achieve and target these 1st   * especially in large organization and and organization at Google, where you have multiple product groups working together. And they have different goals. You need to find, like a a user segment that kinda across these goals. And and all of these products are trying to help this user segment. Then from there grow.   * it. It's 1 tool that's that's broadly used. And they use it along with conjoint survey. So you see? Okay, what? What do these users care about? What motivates them? And what are the problem that they face? So I can tell you, for example, for us in on the health side   * Fitbit side where there's like the what we call active adapter, where these are users that are interested in fitness they're interested in maintaining their health. It's a segment of the population. I don't know how like, what's the percentage of a patient that falls into that. But it's it's fairly a decent segment. So we try to understand. What is it that they are looking for? Via   * what we call Uxr user research. And from there try to build a product that is catering to their needs again, you in here, no matter what segment it is you're gonna end up with like a laundry list and a big demand on this. This is everything that they care about. You need to prioritize that. And you need to really hone in. Okay, on what is it that   * they care? Not necessarily the most about. But they care about in a high percentage or a high priority. And you as an organization, where can you deliver the value? Because, depending on your organization, you might not be able to deliver value across everything. There might be areas where you are better at delivering value there, or you're better at solving their problem versus others. Like if   * I don't wanna say something that I regret, but like, if if users care about a a particular aspect of your product and you as an organization. This is not your expertise. This is not your   * where you excel you, you shouldn't go and try to solve this problem.   * ![John Renaldi][image44]   * **John Renaldi**   * 01:53:56   * Any questions before we break.   * Okay, Maj, thank you so much. Great seeing you, Buddy, we'll talk to you soon.   * ![Majd Bakar][image45]   * **Majd Bakar**   * 01:54:02   * Thank you. Yeah. Thanks. Bye.   * ![John Renaldi][image46]   * **John Renaldi**   * 01:54:04   * All right, we're going to go ahead and break. Give you guys 20 min into our 1st break. So why don't we come back here at a quarter after 11\\.   * It's very exciting.   * All right. We're gonna go ahead and pick up where we left off before we get to our classics.   * I wanna drill a little bit more into this broker innovation where we were kind of ending this idea of   * a way to partner.   * Maybe an accelerator have a venture arm, or this this model where we spin something up.   * The reason why I wanna just sort of spend a little bit more time on this because of something that Maj brought up, which was a question I think maybe she asked, or misappropriate to you. Sorry, but of like would have acquiring a certain technology have helped you   * with stadia that maybe helped solve your problems and made it a successful product.   * And his answer was, actually, I think it would have slowed us down.   * and he said that the reason why is because of the infrastructure of the company.   * What it is really saying is the processes, the things that a big company has to do, that a small company does.   * It needs to work within our infrastructure to make sure it works at scale and cost. It's gotta make sure it has all the reviews for privacy to make sure it's using all the licensing correctly. It's gotta go through the Hr approval of this and that, like, there's all the big company stuff   * that can slow these things down.   * And in the case of Google, their thing is actually infrastructure.   * That is a major hurdle for integration of technology, getting it to run inside of Google's infrastructure.   * And and that was kind of giving you an insight to his answer.   * But that's where the models we just discussed, the incubation, the integration models where I have a labs team or integrated. It's still burdened with those things, it still has to work within the construct of big company procurement like I said, things like this that are inherently meant to scale and be big company things. They're not meant to be applied to a company or a team that's small and minimal.   * And so when you think of what Google had tried to do with alphabet was to try to solve something   * having these types of businesses being the big bets like a little bit outside of the tent. They don't have to have the exact same   * processes that we have. They don't have to have the exact same procurement. Things that we have. Bcg, others do this by by merging together teams from them and putting them outside of the tent, letting them operate independently without the performance, management reviews the procurement, the it requirements, the privacy requirements, and don't get me wrong.   * These are all for good reasons, as you scale.   * And there's a lot of things that are there that are just fundamental truths and good 1st principles. But oftentimes they've been adapted to that big company, and how to scale it, not for how it works smaller.   * And so this idea of putting something outside   * beating it with the people that were inside   * can be a really disruptive model.   * And it's 1 that can challenge really with flexibility the business model of the parent to disrupt within, or to think about a brand new business model that that you know you've heard much say something along the lines of something like the permission to play of like, Hey, like, maybe that's just not something your company is good at like. Maybe you shouldn't do it because you don't have the capabilities   * like that could be an argument right? Google shouldn't build self-driving cars. I guess it's not a self driving car company. Why should they be playing weighbo like, put that outside like. Don't incubate that within Google proper. Put that over here where you can isolate it, let it think different. Let it really push the boundaries, let it challenge the incumbent business model that the current company has.   * So this idea is becoming more and more prevalent, and one that I think has a lot of really interesting legs to it. It also allows you to retain talent. So many of the best, you know. Kind of innovative thinkers, you see, will then leave the company to go, join us, startup, or join their own. This model allows you to retain that talent.   * It allows you to put them into some innovative projects that they get.   * So imagine you're at your company, and you're thinking about leaving the company to go start something. And they came back and said, actually, we'll let you foster that idea, and we'll give you equity in that idea, and let you sit outside the tent like that might be a really great way or path that people know. That's a path to retain that talent and keep them inside the corporation. So   * really interesting model that's evolving and I think it's 1 that deserves attention for any organization that's, you know, kind of challenged with some of these larger company   * strengths.   * But all of these really go back to these bush veil principles that we've been talking about throughout   * 5 weeks really, which is these principles of being able to create some type of phase separation being able to put the artists and the soldiers a bit apart and nurturing them.   * but also allowing you to create that equilibrium that brings them back together and ties them.   * And and we've shown you now different ways. You can do this different strategies to do this. What happens when you don't do this? The park example from Xerox   * ways that it was done very well, using some of the examples from the 1st day of class around the office of research and innovation with radar. And I want to give you just like this one chart that's in the book. To really like, I think, is a great visual.   * To think through. This is this one in the book, so it kind of gives you these like quadrants.   * and that, like top left quadrant   * is like the the chief innovation officer that we need to innovate in the company. Let's go hire a chief innovation officer and create an innovation team and fill it with a bunch of people from outside. It's the thing that's like very strong in terms of like the separation, but like weak in terms of of like the phase separation. Where like, here, you've got the Moses trap of like really strong leader, or park.   * That top right? We're looking for this like   * really great balance. But ideal phase separation that allows that team the independence. So just gonna refer back to this graphic as you think about how you might   * implement these types of changes in your organization to focus on on the future.   * I've been talking about this. So did Maj. We've been talking about this through like the change management best practices the 8 steps. But really, it's like trying to simplify this even more because   * I find myself, especially when I start in a company. And I and I kind of there for maybe a few months I will oftentimes get frustrated by how slow things move.   * and I feel like overwhelmed by like I don't feel like I can make enough change   * and I and I oftentimes refer back to this like very simple model. And I mean, it's really like   * spoken about pretty much in any psychologist or therapist as well, which is like control, the things you can   * and like. Don't worry about the things you can't   * focus on the things you control, make the change local. Even in like political climates we get frustrated, regardless of what side you were on of the aisle. If you were on one side, then last 4 years were very frustrating. This side may be a different way, but it's very easy to get stressed out about all the things that are going on, and you'll hear often, like.   * think local, think small, think about the things you can impact and control and work out, start from the middle and work outwards influence, influence with authority, lead through off, or I'm sorry. Lead with influence, not authority.   * Think about those things that you can control, the things you can change within your team implement those things around culture, hiring practices, phase, separation, inspiration, prototyping whatever you can and work outwards as you start to as you start to expand that influence. And it's   * probably the most important thing of all   * what we talked about today and what Maj brought up as well as like building that coalition.   * and spending the time with the relationships with your peers.   * and becoming a trusted advocate for them.   * and and coming in with How can I help you   * like. If you can come in to talk to your peers organizations. With what can I do to help your team   * start building that trust? It will go so far for you in your career and and implementing change as you build that posse. I can't emphasize it enough, and it's shocking how many times I see team members that join my team or a company, and they spend all their time insular within the team.   * And like, that's all they're doing. And meanwhile, like they're not talking on any tangential teams around them. And it's a huge miss, not just for their career growth. It's a huge miss for ways that we can be collaborating and building more cross platform products. Because most everything I've seen in any company can never be done just within one small team.   * and so don't don't worry like if your company isn't necessarily the most innovative right now, you're a stagnant corporation or organization that you just feel frustrated at like start small. Start with your team start leading through influence, not authority, and thinking through. How can I start to build these up over time, over time over time. It will take a while. But I don't want you to get frustrated because you're sitting in a company that feels stagnant.   * Okay.   * that gets us through our lecture portion for our class. We've got about a half an hour, 35 min left.   * I'd like you guys to get into your teams.   * What I'd like you to do is take through some of the principles that we talked about today about building change.   * I am certain, within your teams. One of you sits in an organization that feels like this, and you could start building small and building up and building influence and building out some of these change management principles. I'd like for you guys to discuss that. Pick one of your organizations, talk about what you could be doing, what you've seen, work, share best practices amongst you, where some of these things struck a chord with you like? Yes, I've done that. Here's the successes I have.   * or here's some things in my company that I think this could be helpful. I want you to discuss those across the team. We're going to share those out. We'll come back at 10 till we'll leave ourselves 10 min for any sort of Q. And a. On the final assignment, or in class, as you move into that final assignment. That's really a reflection of everything we've learned over the past 5 weeks. One last point I want to make before I forget, because I really don't want to forget.   * The 1st assignment was graded this week.   * This is a learning experience. You all can resubmit that assignment. If you'd like to take the feedback   * and resubmit it for a better agreement.   * This is not about judgment about saying you get this grade, and that's it. It's about a learning process. So take the feedback.   * Feedback's a gift.   * Internalize. Talk to some of your peers, get some improvements, resubmit. I'll regrade, and if it's, you know, taking a better approach. Then you'll get the better grade of the 2\\.   * So I just want to make sure that I say that before I leave for okay, so get in with your teams and we'll come back at about we're gonna come back in quarter till share out, and they'll give us a little bit more time. So with anything, just use, say, like the change management principle. So go back to these 8 steps of like change management.   * And so think about how you might be in an organization that could leverage these, or have you have leverage them. Pick one of your companies, discuss, and then we'll come back and talk about how these principles of change management could help you spread about innovation within the company, or how you've seen them work inside of a company you're already at.   * Make sense. That was not the question I am asking. Oh, sorry. I'm sorry, Yvonne. I missed the question. Yeah, yeah, the 10 types of innovation. 1st assignment. Yes, correct. That's the one that you can resubmit.   * Sorry individually, it's individual.   * Thank you.   * Yeah. Sorry.   * The final assignment as individual   * final is sorry the final assignment is individual. Or did I say it was individual team in the syllabus there are 2\\. There are 2 entries, so it's not clear. Tell you what. Get in your groups. I'll go back and look at my notes, and I'll come back to you in a second.   * So it's like the very long.   * Okay, my apologies. It is a team based assignment.   * But obviously, you've done pieces of this already, individually, like the Pr. FAQ, you've already done. So you can kind of consolidate them across your individual contributions. Take the best of synthesize, put them together. I'd also recommend you guys like divide and conquer that. So you all take points of it. Then come back together, discuss, review, collaborate. But yes, it should be a team based assignment submission.   * Thank you.   * Yeah.   * So it sounds like the the process.   * Yeah, I mean, you could.   * So that's the only issue is   * and everything. And so for me, it was really hard.   * It's not strong.   * Yeah, like process.   * Yeah.   * you go back in.   * Yeah, I think.   * Okay, let's go ahead and come together and share out on what we chatted about   * so we still have a few minutes left. If there's any questions on.   * or let you guys all go. So let's go ahead and start with, you guys.   * we were talking about like, yeah, there are small things which we can do with in our area of control, like the diagram   * moved across this by great dimensions of change, and   * that's great. So we are. We are trying to to do that.   * The thing is at some point of time you get a little bit tired of fighting at your own level when on the top? Yeah, in the bigger kind of picture, it doesn't matter really much. What are you doing there? And you keep smashing your head against the brick wall. You're like I heard enough. And then you come to this point of   * fumbling inside, and I cannot wear it anymore. Then you need to think what what is next. What's next? Yeah, listen. Sometimes the organization is not ready to change with you. You know as much as you can do to try to influence. You know, you can use all the tricks and the tool book and the toolkit and   * the org just is stuck sometimes. That's the way that the cards play. Yeah.   * that's what it is. Yeah, no doubt about it. What? What in that we've talked about has haven't you guys tried? So what what have we talked about that you haven't used?   * If we had trouble pretty much everything in different different angles, in different ways. Yep.   * but I think even for us we're talking about celebrations and things like that. Incentives.   * even though we don't have budget. We tried to find other places to even get funding for those like risky places, but it's like, why are we trying this hard work like it should be very simple to create. Do you find that it's because it doesn't align to like a particular business metric or like? What is it, you know, if you had to do an analysis, for, like, pretend you're a leader in your work, why aren't they receptive to these efforts?   * In my example. So we have. We're a really, really big consulting agency. And so our spheres of influence surround pretty much just our client, and has, instead of the company at large. And so, as you grow your sphere of influence, all they care about is, are you growing the account? Are you adding more work streams. And if you're really good at that, here's more work for you to do on that account. But that doesn't translate into growing an innovation practice internally.   * And in really, really big companies, it's just another level of manager, another level of manager that you have to report up your risks. And oftentimes what I've started doing is instead of giving updates and letting my manager tell their manager their manager. I just have a Pdf. Of   * what happened in the last sprint, and I just send it up to everybody. And so at least, I'm telling the story instead of the telephone game of   * ruining everything. And it's a now. It's a risky project instead of hey? Someone's out of office today. Great   * back here in the corner.   * Yeah. Sure. So at my work, I'm in charge of scoping out work and applying budget to it. So one thing I noticed is that, yeah, we had a particular design that   * got passed around from like team to team, right, you know, like staffing shortages like, you know, funding changes things like that. So what happened was, you know, the the CAD model. It became like huge. There was a huge stack of features, because multiple engineers were just modeling on top of modeling and stuff like that. So you had this huge files on   * large file size and open. It was really hard to troubleshoot, you know, making changes so like forever. So   * I start instructing my engineers to   * remodel the part when they're done, so use any sort of like shortcuts whatever to   * get the design to its final state, and then go back and do it the right way. You know.   * Remodel. It was as few features as possible to find all the sketches, and that way when it's done we actually have something to be documented. So it   * puts a little more time on like the modeling time part of it. But it saves us time downstream. When you know if we need to make a revision, it's really easy to go back and find exactly what. How has that changed innovation in your in your company?   * I think.   * What outcome has that enabled, like any   * for us, it becomes easier to to make a vision to change the future. Right? So if there is an update requirement, or we need to look back at all time and say, Okay, like   * both original design intent. You know, how's this change gonna affect maybe, like other systems that are using it? The   * freeze like, easier to throw things easier to see like what the original, the impact.   * Let's go up front. So we kind of talked about stuff that happened at Intel, we sort of dropped our list of pinterest and Google.   * So at pictures, there's kind of like this annual event called the Make a con, where the entire company comes up with this idea of like, Hey, here's something that we could do differently. Or here's something that we want to pursue. And these ideas are are pitched in different forms. It's presented. And there's like this big event, or like the best ideas are highlighted. Now, the, I think   * it's what's great is like, you're trying to create this   * official unofficial space for innovation. Yeah. But at least what I saw from like recently, like the last makeathon, we felt more like feature building rather than innovation. Now, the lesson that I can take from this is like knowing, knowing that this is an annual thing.   * And there's opportunity for people to start thinking about or innovate. Now building up, saying, Okay, makeathon is our outcome.   * So how can we start talking with different people, start drawing people together and then say, like, Hey, here's our innovation for this makeathon, and that can gain a lot of traction. Because what I've seen is that ideas that get the biggest attention or are winning prizes are the ones that are actually getting funded in the following year. And so there's a way that you could sort of   * with the system to basically create for innovation.   * Yeah. And I think also telling this story like how this ladders to the bigger, so fine, if it's an incremental thing that we're pitching that are more of a feature than a new product. How can we tell a narrative? So maybe we can't show all the other things that will build on top of it. But how can we use this as a proof point for the 1st piece of it? How that bigger, inspirational vision of where we want to go even starting with that as we pitch our demo like starting with the big vision. And it's like, but we're gonna start here   * exactly back, and let's go ahead.   * And are you guys all in one group back there? Okay.   * I can share. Basically, we talked to you how this   * 8 steps appeared in all of our companies where I worked. I worked at a Fintech. It's a Canadian version of Robinhood. Essentially, I worked on the growth team as a marketer.   * So my company, our urgency was our priority. One was get to like 50 billion that deposits by the end of the year. So being on the growth team. It's like what? So our team was like, let's run incentive campaigns. So that's essentially like, oh, like for a friend, get $25 bring in like 100,000. We'll give you 1% match.   * So all these campaigns are launching. They're working. What happened is the marketing team. Actually, my team didn't know how to get those dollars into the clients like accounts. Of course, different parts of the org can do it like with interest deposits things like that.   * So I had to form like the guiding coalition. I have a lot of friends on the different engineering teams. So what I did was individually talk to my friends to be like, Oh, hey, like, how does this work? How does this work? And then eventually, I like, was like, Okay, all these manual things like we could do it   * brought them together. And then how to get kind of enabling the org. It's like, Oh, I brought in my manager, and I was like, Hey, we can do all these steps manually showed it to her, and then she was like, Oh, that's great like. We don't need to get resourcing from the rest of like the company. The marketing team could do it all in House   * eventually successfully showed that we can get dollars into the client's account. But then it's not an.   * The operation is not successful if we want to scale it. So then that was basically the proof of concept for my manager. Any naysayers like, what was any strategy on that you used on people that wanted to shoot this down? We kind of just launched it. Our growth teams mentality was like, just get it out there and ask for forgiveness. Then permission, exactly, show them. And eventually like it started creating buzz.   * bunch of like reddit comments. And then, like management was like, Wait, what's happening like? Why isn't this like the client experience people want. And they were like, Hey.   * you guys wanted us to like, get more dollars into the ecosystem. We did so now put an engineering team on the marketing board to build this out, and which is what's happening now. So I guess that was like, I mean, listen, the the ask for forgiveness. Later model like if you, if you are action oriented and you want to get shit done is a very powerful change. Management. Approach right once it's out and did it like?   * All right, what's the downside of that   * downside of? Just like? Let's ship it and ask for you know permission later, you know. Ask forgiveness later in in my industry, it's like, we're creating an audit risk.   * And that's that's certainly fine. You know, certain types of regulated industries. That's a that's a no go right? Yeah. What? What are for industries that maybe aren't as highly regulated. What's the downside risk of the ask for a forgiveness model?   * Well, if it is a success like everyone will jump on it and say, That's me. If it is a failure, it will be just you. There's a lot of arrows. Yeah, but certainly that's that's a downside, especially in an organization that doesn't celebrate failures.   * What about some of the people that that you try to work with. Next time   * you get a reputation as the guy or the girl, or the gal that just goes off and does shit without like trying to be. Bring people with them. Right? You're the you're the cowboy or the cowgirl, like you're not. You're you're you're overly action oriented at the detriment of the rest of the org.   * So like, be careful with that like where it's successful is when you brought together a coalition of the willing with you, then it can work well to bring about change where it doesn't go so well when it's like people told you this was gonna like, Be shitty, or be a problem or whatever, and like you just ignore them, and went and did it anyways, and didn't bring with other people, even if it was successful, then, like you trying to like. Recruit them to ship like version 2 of it.   * Good luck like you kind of burn some bridges there. It can happen to us. We just launched a connected device in North America, and we're slowly launching in Europe. And then the euro marketing or sales team. They're like, well, we expand. All these things are starting to   * sell in different countries, including the Dubai.   * which we don't have like regulations. We don't have it tested anything, and they were already trying to ship product. There, we have to like kind of stop them. Because, like, we don't know what's gonna happen. I guess you can go ahead, and it's fine that there's a lot of excitement around the product. But we don't even know if it's gonna work when you go there, you know. But a good way to find the happy medium is to ship a prototype. Right? Just go and show people, you know. Don't don't tell show. Go off with some of the tools that we've been talking about.   * that we've been showing in the class of, like, how you can go build some things.   * build it yourself, and just just to show people what could be there, I think will be a big help to all of you that these things were not possible last year for most people.   * If you needed something built, you needed to go recruit a developer. There are so many things now that are in your hands to do that. You can show people some of your vision to get them excited. Bring those things as stimulus, bring them as inspiration. A working something is going to be a shit ton better than a Powerpoint presentation from a Pm. It shows that you are a doer. You're getting shit done. You've thought through some stuff. And yeah, it's not perfect. You're not representing his perfect relationship.   * Any engineer will look at that and give you some props on like actually getting some shit done, and it'll be another tool for you to tell your story. It's like, really, really like, try to take merge. These things. Don't don't ask for permission to go do it. But like   * show people, not just not just tell all right, any questions before we go into our final assignment.   * Now that we've clarified it as a group.   * All good.   * Alright guys, it's been an absolute pleasure working with you guys the past 5 weeks.   * Really looking forward, I'm going to be sitting in on your capstone design sessions with Jim and Josh. I get a little bit better feeling for where you all are standing, as it relates to your capstone, so I can prepare for our 10 weeks starting in March as we move into business model. So I'm going to be seeing you guys in a little bit.   * But other than that, I'll see you guys in 5 weeks.   * Right   * bye, Christine, safe travels.   * ![Christine and Josh][image47]   * **Christine and Josh**   * 02:44:57   * See you soon see you in March.   * ![John Renaldi][image48]   * **John Renaldi**   * In March.",
